Project
 
Goals
 
and
 
Use
 
Cases
 
This
 
project
 
aims
 
to
 
streamline
 
and
 
automate
 
several
 
core
 
tasks—presentation
 
creation,
 
code
 
analysis,
 
data
 
visualization,
 
and
 
context-aware
 
querying—via
 
a
 
combination
 
of
 
AI-based
 
text
 
processing,
 
chart
 
generation,
 
and
 
retrieval-augmented
 
generation
 
(RAG).
 
Below
 
are
 
the
 
primary
 
goals
 
and
 
their
 
real-world
 
applications:
 
 
1.
 
Automated
 
Presentation
 
Generation
 
A
 
major
 
focus
 
of
 
the
 
system
 
lies
 
in
 
reading
 
text
 
from
 
diverse
 
sources
 
(PDFs,
 
code
 
repositories,
 
local
 
text
 
files)
 
and
 
using
 
AI
 
to
 
craft
 
polished
 
presentations
.
 
The
 
output
 
often
 
takes
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
HTML
 
files
 
(e.g.,
 
slides.html
 
or
 
presentation.html
),
 
which
 
can
 
then
 
be
 
shared
 
with
 
investors,
 
stakeholders,
 
or
 
team
 
members.
 
Use
 
Case
 
Example
 
Imagine
 
a
 
team
 
preparing
 
for
 
a
 
startup
 
pitch
.
 
They
 
have
 
a
 
50-page
 
PDF
 
documenting
 
their
 
business
 
plan
 
but
 
limited
 
time
 
to
 
build
 
a
 
slideshow.
 
By
 
running
 
a
 
script
 
against
 
the
 
PDF,
 
the
 
system
 
automatically
 
summarizes
 
and
 
converts
 
each
 
section
 
into
 
presentation-ready
 
slides.
 
The
 
result
 
is
 
a
 
high-level,
 
investor-friendly
 
deck
 
that
 
would
 
have
 
otherwise
 
required
 
countless
 
hours
 
of
 
manual
 
design.
 
 
2.
 
Code
 
Analysis
 
and
 
Summaries
 
Beyond
 
presentations,
 
the
 
project
 
includes
 
tools
 
that
 
analyze
 
codebases
,
 
automatically
 
identifying
 
functions,
 
classes
,
 
or
 
even
 
entire
 
files.
 
It
 
then
 
uses
 
AI
 
to
 
produce
 
short,
 
human-readable
 
explanations
 
that
 
describe
 
what
 
each
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
code
 
does.
 
Use
 
Case
 
Example
 
A
 
developer
 
who
 
just
 
joined
 
a
 
company
 
might
 
face
 
a
 
large,
 
unfamiliar
 
repository.
 
By
 
using
 
this
 
feature,
 
they
 
can
 
immediately
 
generate
 
a
 
concise
 
breakdown
 
of
 
every
 
function
 
and
 
class.
 
Instead
 
of
 
sifting
 
through
 
documentation
 
or
 
reading
 
line-by-line,
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
quick
 
reference
 
that
 
speeds
 
up
 
onboarding
 
and
 
helps
 
them
 
become
 
productive
 
faster.
 
 
3.
 
Chart
 
and
 
Diagram
 
Generation
 
Data
 
visualization
 
is
 
another
 
powerful
 
capability
 
of
 
the
 
project.
 
It
 
includes
 
ready-made
 
Python
 
scripts
 
for
 
creating
 
bar
 
charts
,
 
line
 
charts
,
 
pie
 
charts
,
 
and
 
flowcharts
,
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
generated
 
either
 
from
 
AI-processed
 
data
 
or
 
existing
 
CSV/JSON
 
data
.
 
This
 
helps
 
turn
 
raw
 
metrics
 
into
 
insightful
 
graphics
 
for
 
dashboards,
 
reports,
 
or
 
presentations.
 
Use
 
Case
 
Example
 
A
 
data
 
analyst
 
needs
 
to
 
illustrate
 
user
 
growth
 
and
 
churn
 
rates
.
 
Rather
 
than
 
manually
 
configuring
 
each
 
chart
 
in
 
Excel
 
or
 
another
 
tool,
 
the
 
AI
 
can
 
interpret
 
phrases
 
like
 
“user
 
growth
 
is
 
20%
 
every
 
quarter”
 
and
 
automatically
 
produce
 
line
 
or
 
bar
 
charts
 
with
 
appropriate
 
labels
 
and
 
legends.
 
These
 
charts
 
can
 
then
 
be
 
embedded
 
into
 
reports
 
or
 
slides
 
for
 
quick
 
dissemination.
 
 
4.
 
RAG
 
(Retrieval-Augmented
 
Generation)
 
and
 
Embedding
 
A
 
series
 
of
 
scripts—such
 
as
 
rag.py
 
and
 
imagerag.py
—demonstrate
 
retrieval-augmented
 
generation
.
 
In
 
this
 
workflow,
 
text
 
or
 
image
 
embeddings
 
are
 
stored
 
in
 
a
 
vector
 
database
 
(e.g.,
 
IRISVector).
 
Whenever
 
a
 
user
 
poses
 
a
 
question,
 
the
 
system
 
retrieves
 
the
 
most
 
relevant
 
content
 
before
 
passing
 
it
 
to
 
OpenAI’s
 
models
 
for
 
final
 
text
 
generation.
 
Use
 
Case
 
Example
 
Consider
 
a
 
Q&A
 
or
 
research
 
scenario.
 
Suppose
 
someone
 
asks,
 
“How
 
does
 
the
 
mental
 
wellness
 
market
 
look
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
five
 
years?”
 
The
 
system
 
will
 
search
 
its
 
internal
 
dataset
 
(company
 
documents,
 
market
 
research
 
PDFs)
 
and
 
possibly
 
even
 
external
 
sources,
 
retrieve
 
paragraphs
 
on
 
mental
 
health
 
trends,
 
and
 
feed
 
this
 
contextual
 
data
 
to
 
the
 
AI.
 
The
 
user
 
then
 
receives
 
a
 
well-informed,
 
concise
 
response
 
that
 
blends
 
local
 
knowledge
 
with
 
real-time
 
references.
 
√
 
 

From
 
creating
 
entire
 
slide
 
decks
 
to
 
summarizing
 
complex
 
code
 
or
 
visualizing
 
data
,
 
these
 
use
 
cases
 
illustrate
 
how
 
the
 
project
 
effectively
 
automates
 
high-level
 
tasks
 
that
 
typically
 
require
 
a
 
great
 
deal
 
of
 
human
 
effort.
 
By
 
integrating
 
AI-driven
 
workflows
 
and
 
robust
 
data-handling
 
scripts,
 
the
 
system
 
delivers
 
end-to-end
 
solutions
 
for
 
a
 
broad
 
range
 
of
 
real-world
 
challenges.

Final
 
Thoughts
 
This

demonstrates
 
the
 
synergy
 
between
 
automation,
 
AI-driven
 
text
 
processing,
 
and
 
data

By
 
leveraging
 
a
 
modular
 
architecture—where
 
each
 
component
 
(extraction,
 
summarization,
 
chart
 
generation,
 
presentation
 
creation)
 
can
 
work
 
independently
 
or
 
in
 
concert—the
 
system
 
becomes
 
adaptable
 
to
 
a
 
wide
 
range
 
of
 
use
 
cases.
 
Whether
 
the
 
goal
 
is
 
crafting
 
investor
 
pitch
 
decks,
 
generating
 
technical
 
documentation,
 
or
 
providing
 
real-time
 
analytics,
 
this
 
foundation
 
lays
 
out
 
a
 
path
 
that:
 
 
Saves
 
time:
 
Automates
 
repetitive
 
tasks
 
like
 
summarizing
 
code,
 
creating
 
slides,
 
or
 
making

Ensures
 
consistency:
 
Keeps
 
documentation
 
and
 
presentations
 
aligned
 
with
 
the
 
latest
 
data.
 
Scales
 
easily:
 
Works
 
with
 
large
 
codebases,
 
extensive
 
PDFs,
 
or
 
high-volume
 
user
 
data,
 
thanks
 
to
 
chunking
 
and
 
concurrency.
 
Looking
 
ahead,
 
deeper
 
integrations
 
and
 
broader
 
dataset
 
coverage
 
could
 
transform
 
this
 
into
 
a
 
fully
 
end-to-end
 
platform—taking
 
in
 
raw
 
data,
 
processing
 
it
 
for
 
insights,
 
and
 
producing
 
executive-ready
 
deliverables.
 
As
 
AI
 
capabilities
 
evolve,
 
so
 
too
 
will
 
the
 
potential
 
for
 
more
 
interactive,
 
contextual,
 
and
 
personalized
 
outputs,
 
empowering
 
organizations
 
to
 
stay
 
agile
 
in
 
an
 
ever-changing
 
technological
 
landscape.

2.
 
Next.js
 
and
 
Convex
 
Integration
 
Next.js
 
is
 
a
 
framework
 
that
 
combines
 
the
 
power
 
of
 
React
 
with
 
server-side
 
rendering
 
(SSR)
 
and
 
static
 
site
 
generation
 
(SSG).
 
It
 
streamlines
 
page
 
routing,
 
offers
 
optimized
 
performance,
 
and
 
simplifies
 
deployment
 
to
 
platforms
 
like
 
Vercel.
 
Convex
,
 
on
 
the
 
other
 
hand,
 
is
 
a
 
serverless
 
platform
 
tailored
 
for
 
data
 
synchronization
 
and
 
storage.
 
Instead
 
of
 
managing
 
a
 
traditional
 
database
 
and
 
writing
 
boilerplate
 
backend
 
routes,
 
developers
 
can
 
create
 
queries
,
 
mutations
,
 
and
 
actions
 
that
 
are
 
called
 
directly
 
from
 
the
 
front
 
end.
 
Here’s
 
how
 
these
 
components
 
work
 
together:
 
1.
 
pitcher/convex/_generated/api.js
 
○
 
Function
:
 
Automatically
 
generated
 
file
 
that
 
references
 
all
 
Convex
 
functions
 
in
 
a
 
single
 
place.
 
○
 
Usage
:
 
In
 
your
 
React
 
or
 
Next.js
 
component,
 
you
 
can
 
import
 
references
 
to
 
queries
 
or
 
mutations
 
like
 
api.myQueryFunction
 
or
 
api.myMutationFunction
.
 

2.
 
pitcher/convex/_generated/server.js
 
○
 
Function
:
 
Another
 
auto-generated
 
file
 
containing
 
low-level
 
utilities
 
for
 
server-side
 
query/mutation/action
 
definitions.
 
○
 
Implementation
:
 
Developers
 
write
 
code
 
for
 
data
 
retrieval
 
(queries)
 
or
 
modifications
 
(mutations)
 
in
 
dedicated
 
files.
 
Convex
 
then
 
ensures
 
these
 
are
 
exposed
 
to
 
the
 
front
 
end
 
securely,
 
with
 
built-in
 
access
 
control
.
 
3.
 
Query
 
Functions
 
○
 
Definition
:
 
Retrieve
 
data
 
from
 
Convex’s
 
underlying
 
database
 
(e.g.,
 
user
 
profiles,
 
chat
 
messages).
 
○
 
Example
:
 
A
 
query
 
that
 
returns
 
the
 
ten
 
most
 
recent
 
messages
 
in
 
a
 
chat
 
thread,
 
easily
 
accessed
 
from
 
a
 
React
 
component.
 
4.
 
Mutation
 
Functions
 
○
 
Definition
:
 
Insert,
 
update,
 
or
 
delete
 
data
 
in
 
the
 
database.
 
○
 
Example
:
 
A
 
user
 
sends
 
a
 
new
 
message.
 
The
 
mutation
 
validates
 
the
 
user’s
 
identity
 
and
 
appends
 
the
 
message
 
to
 
the
 
conversation
 
table.
 
5.
 
Actions
 
○
 
Definition
:
 
A
 
versatile
 
tool
 
for
 
performing
 
server-side
 
logic
 
that
 
might
 
involve
 
external
 
API
 
calls,
 
file
 
processing,
 
or
 
other
 
asynchronous
 
tasks.
 
○
 
Example
:
 
Integrating
 
a
 
payment
 
gateway,
 
sending
 
confirmation
 
emails,
 
or
 
calling
 
a
 
third-party
 
service.
 
Convex
 
Auth
 
is
 
also
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
picture,
 
allowing
 
for
 
various
 
authentication
 
methods
 
(e.g.,
 
OAuth
,
 
passwordless
,
 
or
 
third-party
 
providers
).
 
Once
 
a
 
user
 
is
 
authenticated,
 
Convex
 
ensures
 
that
 
only
 
permitted
 
actions
 
or
 
queries
 
can
 
be
 
run,
 
reducing
 
the
 
likelihood
 
of
 
unauthorized
 
data
 
access.
 
 
3.
 
Real-Time
 
Data
 
and
 
Synchronization
 
One
 
standout
 
feature
 
of
 
the
 
Next.js
 
+
 
Convex
 
stack
 
is
 
the
 
capability
 
for
 
real-time
 
updates
:
 
●
 
Automatic
 
Subscriptions
:
 
When
 
a
 
React
 
component
 
calls
 
a
 
Convex
 
query
 
with
 
useQuery
,
 
any
 
changes
 
to
 
the
 
underlying
 
data
 
automatically
 
push
 
new
 
updates
 
to
 
the
 
client.
 
●
 
Ideal
 
Use
 
Cases
:
 
○
 
Multi-user
 
chat
:
 
Messages
 
appear
 
instantly
 
without
 
refreshing.
 
○
 
Collaborative
 
editing
:
 
Multiple
 
users
 
can
 
modify
 
shared
 
documents
 
in
 
real-time.
 
○
 
Dashboards
:
 
Charts
 
or
 
metrics
 
refresh
 
live
 
whenever
 
the
 
data
 
changes,
 
without
 
manual
 
reloads.
 
By
 
keeping
 
frontend
 
and
 
backend
 
logic
 
well-coordinated,
 
developers
 
can
 
focus
 
on
 
building
 
features
 
rather
 
than
 
worrying
 
about
 
websockets,
 
infrastructure,
 
or
 
manual
 
polling.
 
 
4.
 
Advantages
 
of
 
This
 
Configuration
 
1.
 
Efficiency
:
 
Developers
 
write
 
minimal
 
backend
 
boilerplate
,
 
thanks
 
to
 
Convex’s
 
query/mutation
 
architecture.
 
2.
 
Scalability
:
 
Next.js
 
pages
 
can
 
be
 
statically
 
generated
 
or
 
rendered
 
on
 
demand,
 
and
 
Convex
 
automatically
 
scales
 
its
 
serverless
 
functions.
 
3.
 
Type
 
Safety
:
 
Coupled
 
with
 
TypeScript,
 
the
 
entire
 
stack—from
 
queries
 
to
 
React
 
components—can
 
be
 
typed,
 
reducing
 
runtime
 
errors.
 
4.
 
Unified
 
Tooling
:
 
ESLint,
 
Prettier,
 
and
 
Tailwind
 
CSS
 
create
 
a
 
standardized
 
environment,
 
ensuring
 
consistent
 
code
 
style,
 
robust
 
linting,
 
and
 
a
 
unified
 
design
 
system.
 
 
5.
 
Putting
 
It
 
All
 
Together
 
In
 
practice,
 
a
 
developer
 
working
 
in
 
pitcher/
 
might:
 
1.
 
Run
 
npm
 
run
 
dev
:
 
This
 
launches
 
both
 
Next.js
 
and
 
Convex
 
in
 
development
 
mode.
 
2.
 
Edit
 
a
 
Query
 
Function
:
 
In
 
convex/messages.ts
,
 
they
 
define
 
query({
 
limit:
 
number
 
})
 
that
 
fetches
 
the
 
last
 
limit
 
messages.
 
3.
 
Call
 
It
 
from
 
a
 
Next.js
 
Page
:
 
In
 
pages/index.tsx
,
 
use
 
const
 
messages
 
=
 
useQuery(api.messages.get,
 
{
 
limit:
 
10
 
})
.
 
The
 
UI
 
automatically
 
updates
 
if
 
messages
 
change.
 
4.
 
Style
 
with
 
Tailwind
:
 
Use
 
utility
 
classes
 
like
 
bg-gray-200
 
p-4
 
rounded-md
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
.tsx
 
file,
 
benefiting
 
from
 
shared
 
styling
 
patterns.
 
5.
 
Deploy
:
 
With
 
a
 
simple
 
push
 
to
 
the
 
repository,
 
both
 
Next.js
 
(on
 
Vercel)
 
and
 
the
 
Convex
 
functions
 
can
 
be
 
deployed,
 
scaling
 
to
 
user
 
demand.
 
This
 
front-end
 
configuration
 
exemplifies
 
a
 
next-generation
 
architecture
 
that
 
combines
 
the
 
best
 
of
 
React
 
and
 
serverless
 
concepts,
 
ensuring
 
real-time
 
user
 
experiences
 
while
 
maintaining
 
type
 
safety
 
and
 
code
 
clarity.

Chart
 
Generation
 
Modules
 
Data
 
visualization
 
is
 
a
 
critical
 
part
 
of
 
communicating
 
insights
 
effectively,
 
whether
 
those
 
insights
 
come
 
from
 
raw
 
numbers,
 
AI-driven
 
analyses,
 
or
 
user-generated
 
content.
 
To
 
address
 
this
 
need,
 
the
 
project
 
includes
 
a
 
dedicated
 
graphs
 
folder
 
containing
 
purpose-built
 
scripts
 
for
 
generating
 
different
 
types
 
of
 
charts.
 
Each
 
script
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
be
 
modular
 
and
 
easy
 
to
 
integrate
,
 
focusing
 
on
 
a
 
specific
 
chart
 
format
 
(bar,
 
line,
 
pie,
 
or
 
flowchart).
 
Below
 
is
 
a
 
detailed
 
overview
 
of
 
each
 
module
 
and
 
how
 
they
 
fit
 
into
 
the
 
broader
 
system.
 
 
1.
 
bar.py
 
●
 
Primary
 
Function
:
 
create_bar_chart(x_values,
 
y_values,
 
labels,
 
title,
 
...)
 
●
 
Key
 
Features
:
 
1.
 
Customizable
 
Bar
 
Labels
:
 
Each
 
bar
 
can
 
display
 
its
 
own
 
label,
 
whether
 
it’s
 
category
 
names
 
or
 
numerical
 
annotations.
 
2.
 
Optional
 
Legend
:
 
If
 
multiple
 
datasets
 
or
 
bar
 
groups
 
are
 
plotted
 
together,
 
a
 
legend
 
can
 
be
 
added
 
for
 
clarity.
 
3.
 
Adjustable
 
Size
 
and
 
Resolution
:
 
The
 
script
 
allows
 
parameters
 
for
 
figure
 
width,
 
height,
 
and
 
DPI
 
(dots
 
per
 
inch)
 
to
 
ensure
 
the
 
chart
 
looks
 
crisp
 
on
 
various
 
displays.
 
Why
 
Use
 
It?
 
Bar
 
charts
 
are
 
excellent
 
for
 
comparing
 
discrete
 
categories
 
or
 
showing
 
changes
 
over
 
time
 
(particularly
 
if
 
the
 
x-axis
 
represents
 
different
 
time
 
periods).
 
By
 
automating
 
the
 
creation
 
of
 
these
 
charts,
 
the
 
project
 
reduces
 
the
 
repetitive
 
burden
 
of
 
manual
 
configuration
 
and
 
styling
 
in
 
Matplotlib.
 
 
2.
 
line.py
 
●
 
Primary
 
Function
:
 
create_line_chart(x_values,
 
y_values,
 
labels,
 
title,
 
...)
 
●
 
Key
 
Features
:
 
1.
 
Support
 
for
 
Multiple
 
Lines
:
 
Users
 
can
 
pass
 
multiple
 
datasets,
 
creating
 
overlapping
 
or
 
comparative
 
lines
 
on
 
a
 
single
 
chart.
 
2.
 
Color
 
Schemes
 
and
 
Markers
:
 
Choose
 
from
 
default
 
color
 
palettes
 
or
 
specify
 
your
 
own.
 
Markers
 
(e.g.,
 
circles,
 
squares)
 
help
 
distinguish
 
data
 
points.
 
3.
 
Grid
 
Overlays
:
 
Optionally
 
enable
 
a
 
grid
 
to
 
improve
 
readability
 
and
 
highlight
 
specific
 
data
 
points
 
or
 
thresholds.
 
Why
 
Use
 
It?
 
Line
 
charts
 
excel
 
at
 
showing
 
trends
 
and
 
changes
 
over
 
continuous
 
intervals
 
(like
 
time).
 
The
 
ability
 
to
 
plot
 
multiple
 
lines
 
makes
 
them
 
ideal
 
for
 
comparing
 
different
 
metrics—such
 
as
 
user
 
growth
 
vs.
 
churn
 
rate—within
 
the
 
same
 
visual.
 
 
3.
 
pie.py
 
●
 
Primary
 
Function
:
 
create_pie_chart(values,
 
labels,
 
title,
 
...)
 
●
 
Key
 
Features
:
 
1.
 
Percentage
 
Display
:
 
Automatically
 
calculates
 
and
 
displays
 
each
 
slice’s
 
percentage
 
of
 
the
 
total.
 
2.
 
Adjustable
 
Legend
 
Placement
:
 
Configure
 
legend
 
inside
 
or
 
outside
 
the
 
pie
 
chart,
 
or
 
disable
 
it
 
altogether.
 
3.
 
Color
 
Customization
:
 
Control
 
the
 
colors
 
of
 
each
 
slice,
 
either
 
randomly
 
generated
 
or
 
specified
 
for
 
consistency
 
across
 
multiple
 
charts.
 
Why
 
Use
 
It?
 
Pie
 
charts
 
provide
 
a
 
quick
 
snapshot
 
of
 
how
 
different
 
parts
 
contribute
 
to
 
a
 
whole.
 
They
 
are
 
especially
 
useful
 
for
 
showing
 
proportions
 
(e.g.,
 
distribution
 
of
 
revenue
 
streams,
 
user
 
demographic
 
segments,
 
or
 
categories
 
of
 
spending).

1.
 
Directed
 
Graph
 
Generation
 
(Graphviz)
:
 
Utilizes
 
the
 
Graphviz
 
library
 
to
 
build
 
visually
 
appealing
 
flowcharts.
 
2.
 
Distinct
 
Node
 
Shapes
:
 
Automatically
 
assigns
 
shapes
 
(ovals,
 
rectangles,
 
diamonds)
 
for
 
steps
 
like
 
start
,
 
process
,
 
decision
,
 
and
 
end
 
to
 
standardize
 
the
 
look.
 
3.
 
Custom
 
Layouts
 
and
 
Directions
:
 
Flowcharts
 
can
 
be
 
oriented
 
left-to-right
 
or
 
top-to-bottom,
 
offering
 
flexibility
 
based
 
on
 
user
 
preference
 
or
 
complexity
 
of
 
the
 
process.
 
Why
 
Use
 
It?
 
Flowcharts
 
are
 
invaluable
 
for
 
process
 
mapping
 
or
 
workflow
 
explanation
.
 
In
 
a
 
startup
 
pitch
 
or
 
technical
 
presentation,
 
they
 
help
 
non-technical
 
stakeholders
 
grasp
 
complex
 
sequences
 
(e.g.,
 
the
 
path
 
of
 
a
 
user
 
request
 
through
 
a
 
microservice
 
architecture).
 
 
5.
 
Example
 
Usage:
 
graphs/process.py
 
In
 
the
 
file
 
graphs/process.py
 
(or
 
a
 
similar
 
orchestrator),
 
the
 
system
 
can
 
prompt
 
an
 
AI
 
to:
 
1.
 
Read
 
a
 
chunk
 
of
 
text
 
(e.g.,
 
a
 
business
 
plan,
 
metrics
 
summary,
 
or
 
user
 
data
 
log).
 
2.
 
Analyze
 
the
 
text
 
to
 
determine
 
which
 
types
 
of
 
charts
 
best
 
represent
 
the
 
data
 
(e.g.,
 
“We
 
have
 
quarterly
 
user
 
growth
 
numbers—use
 
a
 
line
 
chart
,”
 
“We
 
have
 
a
 
breakdown
 
of
 
operating
 
expenses—use
 
a
 
pie
 
chart
”).
 
3.
 
Respond
 
with
 
instructions
 
specifying
 
chart
 
type,
 
labels,
 
colors,
 
and
 
additional
 
parameters.
 
The
 
script
 
then
 
parses
 
these
 
AI
 
instructions,
 
calling
 
the
 
appropriate
 
chart
 
function—
create_bar_chart()
,
 
create_line_chart()
,
 
create_pie_chart()
,
 
or
 
create_flowchart()
.
 
Each
 
output
 
is:
 
●
 
Saved
 
as
 
a
 
PNG
 
(or
 
another
 
image
 
format).
 
●
 
Accompanied
 
by
 
metadata
 
stored
 
in
 
a
 
file
 
(JSON
 
or
 
text),
 
which
 
details
 
the
 
chart’s
 
name,
 
description,
 
file
 
path,
 
and
 
dimensions.
 
This
 
automated
 
approach
 
liberates
 
users
 
from
 
manually
 
configuring
 
each
 
chart
 
in
 
Matplotlib
 
or
 
Graphviz.
 
Instead,
 
they
 
can
 
focus
 
on
 
higher-level
 
tasks—like
 
deciding
 
what
 
data
 
to
 
visualize—and
 
let
 
the
 
system
 
handle
 
the
 
rest.
 
 
6.
 
Modularity
 
and
 
Extensibility
 
The
 
graphs
 
folder
 
is
 
structured
 
to
 
streamline
 
data
 
visualization
 
by
 
separating
 
each
 
chart
 
type
 
into
 
its
 
own
 
module.
 
This
 
design
 
choice
 
has
 
several
 
advantages:
 
1.
 
Easy
 
Maintenance
:
 
Each
 
file
 
(
bar.py
,
 
line.py
,
 
pie.py
,
 
flow.py
)
 
contains
 
only
 
the
 
logic
 
pertinent
 
to
 
its
 
chart
 
type,
 
making
 
bug-fixing
 
or
 
updates
 
more
 
straightforward.
 
2.
 
Consistent
 
Interfaces
:
 
All
 
chart
 
functions
 
follow
 
a
 
similar
 
signature—an
 
input
 
for
 
data
 
values,
 
labels,
 
and
 
optional
 
configuration
 
parameters—so
 
users
 
can
 
quickly
 
learn
 
the
 
pattern.
 
3.
 
Add
 
New
 
Chart
 
Types
:
 
If
 
the
 
project
 
requires
 
a
 
scatter
 
plot
,
 
radar
 
chart
,
 
or
 
another
 
specialized
 
visualization,
 
developers
 
can
 
simply
 
create
 
a
 
new
 
script
 
(e.g.,
 
scatter.py
)
 
following
 
the
 
same
 
approach.
 
4.
 
Reusability
:
 
Other
 
parts
 
of
 
the
 
application
 
can
 
import
 
these
 
scripts
 
as
 
needed,
 
or
 
they
 
can
 
be
 
extracted
 
into
 
a
 
standalone
 
library
 
for
 
broader
 
reuse
 
in
 
multiple
 
projects.
 
 
7.
 
Why
 
Charts
 
Matter
 
for
 
This
 
Project
 
Given
 
the
 
project’s
 
focus
 
on
 
AI-driven
 
insights
—from
 
sentiment
 
analysis
 
to
 
code
 
summaries—visual
 
representations
 
often
 
speak
 
louder
 
than
 
text-based
 
outputs.
 
By
 
generating
 
charts:
 
●
 
Investors
 
or
 
team
 
members
 
can
 
quickly
 
understand
 
key
 
metrics
 
(e.g.,
 
monthly
 
active
 
users,
 
revenue
 
distribution).
 
●
 
Technical
 
stakeholders
 
can
 
see
 
flowcharts
 
that
 
clarify
 
system
 
architecture
 
or
 
user
 
journeys.
 
●
 
Product
 
managers
 
can
 
compare
 
versions
,
 
track
 
performance,
 
or
 
visualize
 
backlogs
 
in
 
an
 
intuitive
 
format.
 
Ultimately,
 
the
 
chart
 
generation
 
modules
 
ensure
 
the
 
project’s
 
data
 
analysis
 
and
 
presentation
 
capabilities
 
remain
 
cohesive
.
 
They
 
form
 
a
 
critical
 
bridge
 
between
 
the
 
raw
 
data
 
or
 
AI-driven
 
textual
 
summaries
 
and
 
the
 
final,
 
actionable
 
insights
 
that
 
inform
 
decisions.
 
 
8.
 
Putting
 
It
 
All
 
Together
 
1.
 
Data
 
Collection
:
 
The
 
project
 
retrieves
 
or
 
extracts
 
data
 
(e.g.,
 
user
 
metrics,
 
code
 
analysis
 
results,
 
financial
 
records)
 
via
 
its
 
extraction
 
scripts
.
 
2.
 
AI
 
Processing
:
 
An
 
AI
 
prompt
 
in
 
graphs/process.py
 
(or
 
another
 
orchestrator)
 
interprets
 
what
 
type
 
of
 
chart
 
is
 
needed.
 
3.
 
Chart
 
Creation
:
 
The
 
relevant
 
function
 
in
 
bar.py
,
 
line.py
,
 
pie.py
,
 
or
 
flow.py
 
is
 
called,
 
generating
 
a
 
chart
 
automatically
.
 
4.
 
Integration
:
 
The
 
PNG
 
(or
 
SVG)
 
images
 
can
 
then
 
be
 
inserted
 
into
 
an
 
HTML
 
slideshow,
 
a
 
PDF
 
report,
 
or
 
a
 
real-time
 
dashboard.
 
Thanks
 
to
 
this
 
modular
 
charting
 
system
,
 
the
 
project
 
confidently
 
transforms
 
raw
 
figures
 
and
 
analytical
 
results
 
into
 
compelling
 
visuals
,
 
amplifying
 
the
 
overall
 
value
 
of
 
the
 
data.
