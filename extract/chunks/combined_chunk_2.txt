AI
 
Integration
 
and
 
Code
 
Generation
 
One
 
of
 
the
 
project’s
 
most
 
compelling
 
features
 
is
 
its
 
ability
 
to
 
automate
 
code
 
documentation
 
and
 
transform
 
structured
 
text
 
into
 
presentations
 
or
 
speeches.
 
By
 
integrating
 
OpenAI’s
 
language
 
models
 
(e.g.,
 
GPT-4),
 
the
 
project
 
streamlines
 
tasks
 
that
 
typically
 
require
 
substantial
 
human
 
effort:
 
generating
 
technical
 
explanations,
 
creating
 
presentation
 
notes,
 
and
 
synchronizing
 
images
 
with
 
text.
 
Below
 
is
 
an
 
in-depth
 
look
 
at
 
how
 
these
 
functionalities
 
work
 
and
 
why
 
they
 
matter.
 
 
1.
 
Automated
 
Code
 
Explanations
 
with
 
codegen
 
Within
 
the
 
.codegen/codemods
 
folder,
 
you’ll
 
find
 
a
 
series
 
of
 
Python
 
scripts
—such
 
as
 
describe.py
—that
 
are
 
designed
 
to
 
analyze
 
codebases
 
and
 
generate
 
human-readable
 
documentation
.
 
Let’s
 
break
 
down
 
the
 
workflow:
 
1.
 
Collection
 
○
 
The
 
script
 
crawls
 
through
 
a
 
codebase,
 
identifying
 
every
 
function
,
 
class
,
 
or
 
file
.
 
○
 
It
 
may
 
rely
 
on
 
Python’s
 
built-in
 
ast
 
(Abstract
 
Syntax
 
Tree)
 
module
 
or
 
custom
 
heuristics
 
to
 
parse
 
the
 
code
 
structure.
 
○
 
Example
:
 
For
 
a
 
repository
 
containing
 
api_server.py
,
 
utils.py
,
 
and
 
main.py
,
 
it
 
locates
 
all
 
function
 
definitions
 
(
def
 
...
)
 
and
 
class
 
declarations
 
(
class
 
...
).
 
2.
 
Explanation
 
○
 
Once
 
the
 
script
 
has
 
a
 
complete
 
list
 
of
 
functions
 
or
 
classes,
 
it
 
sends
 
each
 
snippet
 
to
 
OpenAI
 
via
 
an
 
API
 
call.
 
○
 
Prompt
 
Engineering
:
 
The
 
script
 
typically
 
includes
 
a
 
message
 
like
 
“Explain
 
this
 
function
 
in
 
plain
 
English,”
 
ensuring
 
GPT
 
understands
 
it
 
should
 
produce
 
a
 
concise,
 
developer-friendly
 
overview.
 
○
 
The
 
AI
 
then
 
returns
 
a
 
short
 
explanation
 
describing
 
what
 
each
 
function/class
 
does,
 
including
 
relevant
 
details
 
such
 
as
 
parameters,
 
return
 
values,
 
and
 
the
 
logic
 
flow.
 
3.
 
Output
 
○
 
All
 
AI-generated
 
explanations
 
are
 
then
 
aggregated
 
into
 
a
 
single
 
file—commonly
 
called
 
output.txt
 
or
 
something
 
similar.
 
○
 
The
 
result
 
is
 
effectively
 
a
 
human-readable
 
specification
 
or
 
mini-doc
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
stored
 
alongside
 
the
 
code
 
in
 
the
 
repository.
 
○
 
Benefit
:
 
New
 
developers
 
can
 
quickly
 
review
 
output.txt
 
to
 
gain
 
a
 
high-level
 
understanding
 
of
 
every
 
component
 
without
 
having
 
to
 
read
 
the
 
source
 
line-by-line.
 
Why
 
This
 
Matters
 
●
 
Reduces
 
Onboarding
 
Time
:
 
Newcomers
 
to
 
a
 
project
 
can
 
read
 
an
 
AI-written
 
summary
 
rather
 
than
 
deciphering
 
function
 
calls
 
across
 
dozens
 
of
 
files.
 
●
 
Maintains
 
Consistency
:
 
Because
 
the
 
process
 
can
 
be
 
re-run
 
periodically,
 
the
 
documentation
 
stays
 
up-to-date
 
as
 
code
 
evolves.
 
●
 
Scalable
:
 
It’s
 
easy
 
to
 
integrate
 
into
 
CI/CD
 
pipelines—whenever
 
code
 
changes,
 
a
 
job
 
can
 
regenerate
 
the
 
doc,
 
ensuring
 
minimal
 
drift
 
between
 
code
 
and
 
docs.
 
 
2.
 
Speech
 
and
 
Presentation
 
Generation:
 
el_pitcher/pgen.py
 
and
 
pget.py
 
While
 
codegen
 
scripts
 
focus
 
on
 
technical
 
documentation,
 
other
 
tools
 
in
 
the
 
el_pitcher
 
directory
 
aim
 
to
 
transform
 
structured
 
Markdown
 
content
 
into
 
compelling
 
narratives
—perfect
 
for
 
presentations
,
 
conferences
,
 
or
 
investor
 
pitches
.
 
2.1
 
pgen.py
 
1.
 
Markdown
 
Reading
 
○
 
This
 
script
 
opens
 
a
 
Markdown
 
file
 
that
 
a
 
user
 
has
 
prepared.
 
The
 
file
 
might
 
contain
 
slide
 
outlines,
 
bullet
 
points,
 
or
 
headings.
 
○
 
It
 
also
 
extracts
 
any
 
image
 
references
 
and
 
descriptions
 
to
 
ensure
 
visuals
 
can
 
be
 
paired
 
correctly
 
with
 
textual
 
content.
 
2.
 
Prompt
 
Construction
 
○
 
With
 
both
 
text
 
and
 
image
 
metadata
 
in
 
hand,
 
pgen.py
 
assembles
 
a
 
system
 
or
 
user
 
prompt
 
instructing
 
GPT-4
 
to
 
produce
 
a
 
specific
 
style
 
of
 
speech—often
 
“humorous
 
and
 
relatable.”
 
○
 
The
 
script
 
might
 
specify
 
the
 
required
 
tone
,
 
format
 
(bullet
 
points,
 
paragraphs,
 
or
 
sections),
 
and
 
length
 
constraints.
 
3.
 
AI
 
Generation
 
○
 
GPT-4
 
processes
 
the
 
prompt
 
and
 
returns
 
a
 
coherent
 
narrative
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
read
 
aloud,
 
inserted
 
into
 
slides,
 
or
 
shared
 
as
 
a
 
script.
 
○
 
Example:
 
If
 
the
 
Markdown
 
file
 
details
 
a
 
new
 
mental
 
wellness
 
startup,
 
GPT-4
 
might
 
produce
 
an
 
engaging
 
pitch
 
that
 
references
 
relevant
 
images
 
at
 
the
 
appropriate
 
moments.
 
4.
 
Output
 
○
 
The
 
final
 
text
 
is
 
printed
 
to
 
the
 
console
 
or
 
saved
 
into
 
a
 
file,
 
giving
 
the
 
user
 
a
 
ready-made
 
speech.
 
○
 
Users
 
can
 
then
 
refine
 
or
 
edit
 
it,
 
typically
 
taking
 
far
 
less
 
time
 
than
 
writing
 
a
 
speech
 
from
 
scratch.
 
2.2
 
pget.py
 
1.
 
Image
 
Extraction
 
○
 
Unlike
 
pgen.py
,
 
which
 
focuses
 
on
 
generating
 
speech,
 
pget.py
 
zeroes
 
in
 
on
 
extracting
 
image
 
URLs
 
and
 
pairing
 
them
 
with
 
descriptions
 
from
 
a
 
JSON
 
metadata
 
file.
 
○
 
This
 
is
 
crucial
 
if
 
your
 
Markdown
 
includes
 
placeholders
 
such
 
as
 
![alt
 
text](images/chart.png)
 
but
 
you
 
also
 
have
 
a
 
JSON
 
that
 
describes
 
each
 
image
 
in
 
more
 
detail.
 
2.
 
Description
 
Pairing
 
○
 
For
 
each
 
image
 
URL
 
in
 
the
 
Markdown,
 
the
 
script
 
looks
 
up
 
the
 
corresponding
 
description
 
in
 
the
 
JSON
 
data.
 
○
 
If
 
a
 
match
 
is
 
found,
 
it
 
pairs
 
them,
 
so
 
the
 
final
 
output
 
can
 
say:
 
“Image:
 
images/chart.png
 
–
 
Description:
 
‘This
 
chart
 
shows
 
user
 
growth
 
over
 
the
 
past
 
6
 
months.’”
 
○
 
If
 
no
 
match
 
is
 
found,
 
it
 
might
 
note
 
“No
 
description
 
available.”
 
3.
 
Use
 
in
 
Dynamic
 
Slideshows
 
○
 
The
 
aggregated
 
text/image
 
references
 
can
 
then
 
be
 
fed
 
into
 
other
 
presentation-generation
 
scripts
 
or
 
used
 
to
 
create
 
an
 
HTML
 
slideshow.
 
○
 
This
 
ensures
 
every
 
slide
 
referencing
 
an
 
image
 
automatically
 
includes
 
alt
 
text
 
or
 
descriptive
 
captions,
 
improving
 
accessibility
 
and
 
engagement
.
 
Why
 
These
 
Scripts
 
Are
 
Powerful
 
Together
 
●
 
Complete
 
Presentation
 
Pipeline
:
 
In
 
a
 
few
 
steps,
 
a
 
user
 
can
 
go
 
from
 
a
 
basic
 
Markdown
 
outline
 
to
 
a
 
fully
 
formed,
 
AI-generated
 
speech
 
with
 
embedded
 
images.
 
●
 
Multi-Format
 
Output
:
 
The
 
text
 
can
 
be
 
read
 
out
 
loud,
 
turned
 
into
 
slides,
 
or
 
used
 
as
 
a
 
script
 
for
 
a
 
live
 
pitch.
 
●
 
Efficiency
:
 
Minimal
 
manual
 
labor—just
 
structure
 
your
 
Markdown,
 
let
 
the
 
scripts
 
do
 
the
 
heavy
 
lifting.
 
 
3.
 
Synergy
 
and
 
Workflow
 
When
 
using
 
codegen/describe.py
 
alongside
 
el_pitcher/pgen.py
 
and
 
pget.py
,
 
a
 
project
 
can:
 
1.
 
Generate
 
Technical
 
Docs
 
for
 
the
 
codebase,
 
ensuring
 
any
 
complicated
 
logic
 
or
 
architecture
 
is
 
well-explained.
 
2.
 
Craft
 
a
 
Presentation
 
or
 
Speech
 
from
 
a
 
simple
 
Markdown
 
outline
 
that
 
references
 
the
 
code
 
or
 
images
 
described
 
earlier.
 
3.
 
Combine
 
everything
 
into
 
a
 
single
 
slide
 
deck
 
(HTML
 
or
 
PDF)
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
shared
 
with
 
stakeholders,
 
or
 
use
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
script
 
for
 
an
 
audio
 
or
 
video
 
presentation.
 
Example
 
Scenario
 
●
 
A
 
startup
 
wants
 
to
 
do
 
a
 
“code
 
walkthrough”
 
presentation
 
for
 
new
 
investors.
 
1.
 
Run
 
describe.py
 
on
 
the
 
codebase.
 
Output
 
is
 
a
 
text
 
file
 
explaining
 
each
 
major
 
function
 
and
 
class.
 
2.
 
Prepare
 
a
 
simple
 
Markdown
 
file
 
titled
 
investor_pitch.md
 
that
 
includes
 
bullet
 
points
 
about
 
the
 
technology,
 
the
 
team,
 
some
 
architectural
 
diagrams,
 
and
 
references
 
to
 
code
 
features.
 
3.
 
Use
 
pgen.py
 
to
 
transform
 
investor_pitch.md
 
into
 
a
 
lively
 
pitch
 
script,
 
automatically
 
weaving
 
in
 
the
 
code
 
explanations
 
from
 
the
 
text
 
file
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
any
 
relevant
 
images.
 
4.
 
Use
 
pget.py
 
to
 
ensure
 
each
 
image
 
in
 
the
 
final
 
presentation
 
references
 
the
 
correct
 
metadata
 
(alt
 
text,
 
chart
 
descriptions,
 
etc.).

Future
 
Potential
 
and
 
Customization
 
1.
 
Extended
 
Code
 
Analysis
 
○
 
Scripts
 
like
 
describe.py
 
can
 
be
 
further
 
enhanced
 
to
 
detect
 
design
 
patterns
,
 
performance
 
hotspots
,
 
or
 
security
 
concerns
.
 
The
 
AI
 
could
 
highlight
 
potential
 
issues
 
or
 
best
 
practices,
 
making
 
the
 
codebase
 
“self-auditing.”
 
2.
 
Multi-Language
 
Support
 
○
 
Many
 
codegen
 
scripts
 
are
 
flexible
 
enough
 
to
 
handle
 
different
 
programming
 
languages.
 
By
 
adjusting
 
the
 
prompt
 
and
 
heuristics,
 
a
 
team
 
could
 
use
 
them
 
to
 
describe
 
Java,
 
C++,
 
or
 
even
 
specialized
 
domain
 
languages.
 
3.
 
Enhanced
 
Image
 
Integration
 
○
 
Combining
 
pget.py
 
with
 
more
 
advanced
 
image
 
recognition
 
could
 
lead
 
to
 
slides
 
that
 
seamlessly
 
integrate
 
text,
 
code
 
samples,
 
and
 
visual
 
content—each
 
with
 
thorough
 
AI-generated
 
descriptors.
 
4.
 
Live
 
Presentations
 
○
 
With
 
slight
 
adaptations,
 
the
 
content
 
produced
 
by
 
pgen.py
 
could
 
be
 
fed
 
into
 
real-time
 
speech
 
synthesis,
 
enabling
 
an
 
AI-driven
 
voiceover
 
or
 
live
 
teleprompting
 
system
 
for
 
presenters.
 
 
5.
 
Conclusion
 
The
 
AI
 
Integration
 
and
 
Code
 
Generation
 
facet
 
of
 
this
 
project
 
merges
 
the
 
power
 
of
 
GPT
 
models
 
with
 
structured
 
inputs
 
(code
 
snippets,
 
Markdown
 
files,
 
image
 
metadata).
 
Scripts
 
like
 
describe.py
,
 
pgen.py
,
 
and
 
pget.py
 
form
 
a
 
cohesive
 
mini-suite,
 
each
 
solving
 
a
 
piece
 
of
 
the
 
puzzle:
 
●
 
describe.py
 
automates
 
technical
 
documentation,
 
ensuring
 
clarity
 
and
 
maintainability
 
of
 
large
 
or
 
complex
 
codebases.
 
●
 
pgen.py
 
repurposes
 
Markdown
 
content
 
into
 
fully
 
formed
 
speeches
 
or
 
presentations,
 
reducing
 
the
 
writing
 
effort
 
for
 
conferences
 
or
 
pitches.
 
●
 
pget.py
 
ensures
 
images
 
are
 
paired
 
with
 
correct
 
descriptions
 
and
 
alt
 
texts,
 
bolstering
 
both
 
visual
 
clarity
 
and
 
accessibility.
 
By
 
leveraging
 
these
 
scripts
 
together,
 
teams
 
can
 
drastically
 
cut
 
down
 
on
 
manual
 
tasks
 
(writing
 
docs,
 
building
 
slides,
 
drafting
 
speeches)
 
while
 
increasing
 
consistency
 
and
 
quality
.
 
This
 
synergy
 
not
 
only
 
accelerates
 
development
 
and
 
communication
 
but
 
also
 
highlights
 
the
 
transformative
 
potential
 
of
 
AI
 
when
 
integrated
 
thoughtfully
 
into

Data
 
Extraction
 
and
 
Summarization
 
Tools
 
\
 
A
 
central
 
challenge
 
in
 
many
 
data-driven
 
applications
 
is
 
collecting,
 
cleaning,
 
and
 
transforming
 
raw
 
materials—whether
 
it’s
 
code
 
from
 
a
 
repository,
 
text
 
from
 
a
 
PDF,
 
or
 
images
 
embedded
 
in
 
pages.
 
This
 
project
 
tackles
 
that
 
challenge
 
with
 
a
 
highly
 
modular
 
set
 
of
 
Python
 
scripts
 
designed
 
to
 
retrieve,
 
parse,
 
and
 
summarize
 
various
 
types
 
of
 
content.
 
Below,
 
we
 
dive
 
deep
 
into
 
each
 
file
 
and
 
its
 
core
 
functionalities,
 
highlighting
 
how
 
they
 
integrate
 
into
 
the
 
broader
 
system.
 
 
1.
 
extract_links.py
 
a.
 
GitHub
 
Cloning
 
 
Purpose:
 
Obtain
 
codebases
 
from
 
GitHub
 
quickly,
 
ensuring
 
a
 
local
 
copy
 
is
 
available
 
for
 
further
 
analysis
 
(e.g.,
 
summarization
 
or
 
function-by-function
 
breakdown).
 
Implementation:
 
Executes
 
a
 
git
 
clone
 
command
 
under
 
the
 
hood.
 
Creates
 
or
 
cleans
 
a
 
target
 
directory
 
(often
 
named
 
code_data)
 
to
 
maintain
 
a
 
fresh
 
environment.
 
Error
 
Handling:
 
If
 
the
 
repository
 
cannot
 
be
 
cloned
 
(due
 
to
 
invalid
 
URL
 
or
 
network
 
issues),
 
it
 
gracefully
 
reports
 
the
 
error
 
rather
 
than
 
crashing.
 
b.
 
Google
 
Drive
 
Download
 
 
Purpose:
 
Handle
 
public
 
Google
 
Drive
 
folders,
 
particularly
 
for
 
quick
 
tests
 
or
 
proof-of-concept
 
data
 
retrieval.
 
Key
 
Library:
 
gdown,
 
which
 
downloads
 
files
 
shared
 
publicly
 
on
 
Google
 
Drive.
 
Flow:
 
Receives
 
a
 
folder
 
URL
 
and
 
an
 
output
 
directory.
 
Parses
 
the
 
folder
 
URL
 
to
 
extract
 
the
 
unique
 
ID.
 
Invokes
 
gdown
 
commands
 
to
 
download
 
all
 
files
 
into
 
the
 
specified
 
local
 
directory.
 
Prints
 
logs
 
or
 
messages
 
confirming
 
success
 
or
 
warnings
 
in
 
case
 
any
 
file
 
fails
 
to
 
download.
 
Significance:
 
extract_links.py
 
is
 
often
 
the
 
entry
 
point
 
for
 
bringing
 
external
 
data
 
into
 
the
 
system—pulling
 
code
 
from
 
GitHub
 
or
 
textual
 
assets
 
from
 
Drive.
 
By
 
separating
 
this
 
functionality
 
into
 
a
 
standalone
 
script,
 
the
 
project’s
 
architecture
 
remains
 
modular
 
and
 
scalable,
 
allowing
 
the
 
same
 
code
 
to
 
be
 
reused
 
in
 
different
 
pipelines.

drive_extract.py
 
a.
 
Advanced
 
Google
 
Drive
 
Integration
 
 
Authentication
 
via
 
OAuth:
 
The
 
script
 
checks
 
for
 
credentials
 
(token.pickle),
 
or
 
prompts
 
the
 
user
 
to
 
authenticate
 
via
 
the
 
browser.
 
This
 
ensures
 
secure
 
access
 
to
 
private
 
or
 
team
 
drives,
 
not
 
just
 
public
 
links.
 
Folder
 
ID
 
Extraction:
 
Uses
 
a
 
regex
 
or
 
URL
 
parsing
 
logic
 
to
 
reliably
 
isolate
 
the
 
Drive
 
folder’s
 
ID.
 
b.
 
Listing
 
and
 
Downloading
 
Files
 
 
Listing
 
Files:
 
The
 
script
 
queries
 
the
 
Drive
 
API
 
(through
 
the
 
Google
 
Python
 
client
 
libraries)
 
to
 
obtain
 
a
 
full
 
list
 
of
 
items
 
(documents,
 
PDFs,
 
images,
 
etc.)
 
in
 
the
 
folder.
 
Pagination:
 
If
 
the
 
folder
 
contains
 
many
 
files,
 
it
 
cycles
 
through
 
pages
 
of
 
API
 
results,
 
building
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
inventory.
 
Downloading:
 
Each
 
file
 
is
 
retrieved
 
via
 
an
 
authenticated
 
call,
 
possibly
 
with
 
progress
 
bars
 
to
 
keep
 
users
 
informed.
 
Output
 
Management:
 
The
 
script
 
clears
 
or
 
preps
 
the
 
local
 
target
 
directory
 
to
 
avoid
 
clutter
 
and
 
name
 
collisions.
 
Significance:
 
Whereas
 
extract_links.py
 
focuses
 
on
 
public
 
files,
 
drive_extract.py
 
is
 
for
 
more
 
controlled
 
or
 
private
 
usage.
 
It
 
stands
 
out
 
by
 
handling
 
authentication
 
and
 
file
 
listing
 
comprehensively,
 
making
 
it
 
a
 
crucial
 
tool
 
for
 
corporate
 
environments
 
or
 
personal
 
accounts
 
with
 
sensitive
 
data.
 
 

3.
 
extract_text_code.py
 
a.
 
Chunking
 
and
 
Summarization
 
 
Core
 
Classes:
 
TextChunker:
 
Splits
 
text
 
into
 
smaller
 
segments
 
(chunks)
 
for
 
more
 
efficient
 
AI
 
processing.
 
TextProcessor:
 
Applies
 
specific
 
logic
 
(e.g.,
 
summarization
 
prompts)
 
to
 
each
 
chunk.
 
Process
 
Flow:
 
Read
 
files
 
from
 
a
 
specified
 
directory
 
(could
 
be
 
code
 
files,
 
.txt,
 
.md,
 
or
 
partial
 
logs).
 
Chunk
 
the
 
content
 
to
 
stay
 
under
 
a
 
certain
 
token
 
threshold
 
(e.g.,
 
2,000
 
tokens
 
per
 
chunk)
 
so
 
as
 
not
 
to
 
exceed
 
the
 
model’s
 
limit.
 
Generate
 
Summaries
 
or
 
Extracted
 
Content
 
using
 
OpenAI’s
 
API.
 
Compile
 
the
 
final
 
output
 
(multiple
 
chunks
 
combined)
 
into
 
one
 
or
 
more
 
textual
 
summaries.
 
b.
 
Outputs
 
 
Often
 
saved
 
as
 
.txt
 
or
 
.md
 
files
 
in
 
a
 
well-defined
 
structure.
 
May
 
produce
 
an
 
aggregate
 
summary
 
for
 
an
 
entire
 
repository
 
or
 
a
 
bullet-point
 
list
 
capturing
 
key
 
details
 
(depending
 
on
 
the
 
user’s
 
chosen
 
mode).
 
Significance:
 
This
 
script
 
is
 
pivotal
 
for
 
turning
 
large,
 
unwieldy
 
text
 
or
 
code
 
files
 
into
 
smaller,
 
AI-compatible
 
portions.
 
It
 
addresses
 
a
 
fundamental
 
limitation
 
of
 
many
 
LLMs
 
(token
 
constraints)
 
and
 
automates
 
the
 
summarization
 
pipeline.
 
 
4.
 
extract/chunker.py
 
a.
 
File-Type
 
Based
 
Extraction
 
 
Identifies
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
each
 
file
 
(e.g.,
 
.pdf,
 
.html,
 
.json,
 
.xml).
 
Uses
 
the
 
appropriate
 
library:
 
PDF:
 
PyPDF2
 
or
 
similar
 
for
 
text
 
extraction.
 
HTML/XML:
 
BeautifulSoup
 
to
 
strip
 
tags
 
or
 
gather
 
textual
 
content.
 
JSON:
 
Python’s
 
json
 
module
 
for
 
reading
 
structured
 
data.
 
Plain
 
Text:
 
Straight
 
file
 
reads,
 
line
 
by
 
line.
 
b.
 
Token
 
Limit
 
Handling
 
 
Why
 
Token
 
Limits
 
Matter:
 
LLMs
 
like
 
GPT
 
have
 
an
 
upper
 
bound
 
for
 
how
 
many
 
tokens
 
can
 
be
 
processed
 
in
 
a
 
single
 
request
 
(~4,000,
 
8,000,
 
or
 
more,
 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
model).
 
Mechanics:
 
Tracks
 
cumulative
 
token
 
size
 
as
 
text
 
is
 
read
 
in.
 
Once
 
it
 
hits
 
the
 
threshold,
 
it
 
splits
 
the
 
chunk
 
and
 
starts
 
a
 
new
 
file
 
or
 
chunk.
 
Benefits:
 
Minimizes
 
errors
 
from
 
“input
 
too
 
large”
 
issues
 
and
 
ensures
 
that
 
each
 
chunk
 
is
 
coherently
 
sized
 
for
 
high-quality
 
AI
 
analysis.
 
c.
 
Output
 
Management
 
 
The
 
script
 
might
 
generate
 
filenames
 
like
 
chunk_001.txt,
 
chunk_002.txt,
 
etc.
 
Records
 
are
 
often
 
kept
 
in
 
a
 
manifest
 
(e.g.,
 
.json)
 
that
 
tracks
 
which
 
chunk
 
belongs
 
to
 
which
 
original
 
file.
 
Significance:
 
chunker.py
 
is
 
at
 
the
 
heart
 
of
 
scalability.
 
It
 
ensures
 
that
 
no
 
single
 
file—regardless
 
of
 
length—breaks
 
the
 
AI
 
pipeline.
 
By
 
standardizing
 
chunk
 
creation,
 
the
 
entire
 
system
 
can
 
handle
 
very
 
large
 
PDFs,
 
multi-thousand-line
 
codebases,
 
or
 
complex
 
HTML
 
documents.
 
 
5.
 
extract/summarizer.py
 
a.
 
Modes
 
of
 
Operation
 
 
extract:
 
Focuses
 
on
 
retrieving
 
key
 
facts
 
or
 
bullet
 
points
 
(think
 
of
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
“highlight
 
reel”
 
from
 
the
 
text).
 
summarize:
 
Creates
 
more
 
fluid,
 
narrative
 
summaries,
 
preserving
 
the
 
context
 
and
 
meaning
 
while
 
compressing
 
the
 
volume
 
of
 
text.
 
b.
 
Concurrency
 
with
 
asyncio
 
 
Why
 
Concurrency?
 
Processing
 
large
 
sets
 
of
 
files
 
sequentially
 
can
 
be
 
time-consuming,
 
especially
 
if
 
each
 
chunk
 
triggers
 
an
 
AI
 
API
 
call.
 
Implementation:
 
Utilizes
 
Python’s
 
asyncio
 
or
 
libraries
 
like
 
aiohttp
 
to
 
manage
 
multiple
 
AI
 
requests
 
in
 
parallel.
 
Achieves
 
significant
 
time
 
savings
 
when
 
dealing
 
with
 
dozens
 
or
 
hundreds
 
of
 
files.
 
c.
 
Prompt
 
Engineering
 
 
Each
 
mode
 
uses
 
a
 
distinct
 
prompt
 
template
 
for
 
OpenAI.
 
Extract
 
prompt
 
might
 
say,
 
“List
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
bullet
 
points
 
or
 
key
 
data.”
 
Summarize
 
prompt
 
might
 
say,
 
“Create
 
a
 
concise,
 
coherent
 
summary
 
in
 
a
 
neutral
 
tone.”
 
Result:
 
More
 
targeted
 
and
 
high-quality
 
output
 
that
 
aligns
 
with
 
user
 
needs.
 
Significance:
 
extract/summarizer.py
 
tailors
 
the
 
style
 
of
 
AI-driven
 
text
 
transformation.
 
It
 
allows
 
the
 
user
 
to
 
choose
 
between
 
fact-focused
 
bullet
 
points
 
or
 
a
 
more
 
narrative
 
approach.
 
Concurrency
 
ensures
 
it
 
remains
 
efficient
 
at
 
scale.
 
 
6.
 
imgextract.py
 
a.
 
Image
 
Extraction
 
from
 
PDFs
 
 
Walks
 
through
 
each
 
page
 
of
 
a
 
PDF,
 
identifying
 
embedded
 
images.
 
Methods:
 
May
 
rely
 
on
 
libraries
 
like
 
pdf2image
 
or
 
direct
 
PDF
 
metadata
 
parsing
 
to
 
locate,
 
decode,
 
and
 
export
 
images.
 
b.
 
OpenAI’s
 
Vision
 
API
 
(Hypothetical
 
Integration)
 
 
In
 
some
 
future
 
or
 
experimental
 
setups,
 
once
 
images
 
are
 
extracted,
 
they
 
can
 
be
 
sent
 
to
 
an
 
AI
 
image
 
analysis
 
endpoint
 
(OpenAI’s
 
or
 
a
 
third-party).
 
Output:
 
A
 
short
 
textual
 
description
 
or
 
“alt
 
text”
 
for
 
each
 
image,
 
providing
 
context
 
on
 
what
 
the
 
image
 
depicts.
 
c.
 
Metadata
 
Compilation
 
 
For
 
each
 
extracted
 
image,
 
the
 
script
 
may
 
store:
 
File
 
Path:
 
Where
 
the
 
image
 
is
 
saved
 
locally.
 
Description:
 
The
 
AI-generated
 
textual
 
explanation.
 
Page
 
Context:
 
Potentially
 
the
 
text
 
found
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
page
 
or
 
a
 
short
 
excerpt
 
to
 
anchor
 
the
 
image’s
 
meaning.
 
Writes
 
all
 
of
 
this
 
data
 
to
 
a
 
JSON
 
file
 
(e.g.,
 
image_metadata.json),
 
creating
 
a
 
reference
 
that
 
other
 
scripts
 
or
 
a
 
front-end
 
can
 
easily
 
query.
 
Significance:
 
Handling
 
images
 
is
 
crucial
 
in
 
document-heavy
 
or
 
visual
 
use
 
cases—marketing
 
materials,
 
scientific
 
PDFs,
 
or
 
user
 
manuals.
 
By
 
automatically
 
generating
 
textual
 
descriptions,
 
the
 
system
 
not
 
only
 
enables
 
AI
 
to
 
“understand”
 
images
 
but
 
also
 
improves
 
accessibility
 
(e.g.,
 
alt
 
text
 
for
 
visually
 
impaired
 
users).
 
 
7.
 
Collective
 
Impact
 
and
 
Integration
 
Why
 
These
 
Tools
 
Matter
 
Together
 
 
Unified
 
Data
 
Flow:
 
The
 
system
 
can
 
begin
 
with
 
a
 
remote
 
repository
 
(via
 
extract_links.py),
 
parse
 
it
 
(with
 
extract_text_code.py),
 
chunk
 
it
 
(chunker.py),
 
summarize
 
it
 
(summarizer.py),
 
and
 
even
 
handle
 
embedded
 
visuals
 
(imgextract.py).
 
Normalization:
 
Everything—text
 
or
 
images—becomes
 
normalized
 
data
 
(i.e.,
 
textual
 
metadata)
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
fed
 
into
 
AI
 
models
 
or
 
stored
 
for
 
later
 
retrieval.
 
Customizable:
 
By
 
tweaking
 
scripts,
 
users
 
can
 
add
 
specialized
 
logic,
 
better
 
chunking
 
rules,
 
or
 
new
 
summarization
 
styles.
 
Scalable:
 
Thanks
 
to
 
concurrency
 
and
 
modular
 
design,
 
the
 
system
 
can
 
scale
 
to
 
large
 
corpuses
 
of
 
documents
 
or
 
codebases
 
without
 
rewriting
 
each
 
step.
 
End-to-End
 
Workflow
 
Example
 
 
User
 
provides
 
a
 
Google
 
Drive
 
folder
 
link
 
containing
 
multiple
 
PDFs
 
and
 
images.
 
The
 
system
 
authenticates
 
with
 
Google
 
(drive_extract.py),
 
downloads
 
all
 
items,
 
and
 
extracts
 
text
 
from
 
the
 
PDFs
 
(chunker.py).
 
For
 
each
 
large
 
PDF,
 
the
 
text
 
is
 
split
 
into
 
chunks,
 
then
 
summarized
 
or
 
extracted
 
for
 
bullet
 
points
 
(summarizer.py).
 
Images
 
found
 
in
 
the
 
PDF
 
pages
 
are
 
exported
 
and
 
described
 
(imgextract.py).
 
All
 
final
 
materials—text
 
summaries,
 
bullet
 
points,
 
image
 
metadata—are
 
stored
 
in
 
a
 
structured
 
output
 
folder
 
or
 
a
 
combined
 
.json
 
index.
 
The
 
user
 
or
 
subsequent
 
scripts
 
can
 
now
 
generate
 
presentations,
 
chatbots,
 
or
 
Q&A
 
systems
 
from
 
this
 
richly
 
annotated
 
dataset.

Conclusion
 
The
 
arsenal
 
of
 
scripts
 
on
 
Page
 
5
 
form
 
the
 
data
 
extraction
 
and
 
summarization
 
backbone
 
of
 
this
 
project.
 
From
 
straightforward
 
tasks
 
(like
 
cloning
 
a
 
GitHub
 
repo)
 
to
 
sophisticated
 
operations
 
(like
 
extracting
 
images
 
from
 
PDFs
 
and
 
describing
 
them
 
with
 
AI),
 
these
 
tools
 
are
 
modular,
 
extensible,
 
and
 
designed
 
for
 
scale.
 
By
 
breaking
 
large
 
jobs
 
into
 
chunks,
 
automating
 
AI
 
calls,
 
and
 
carefully
 
respecting
 
token
 
limits,
 
this
 
toolkit
 
addresses
 
the
 
core
 
challenge
 
of
 
transforming
 
raw,
 
messy
 
data
 
into
 
insightful,
 
structured
 
content
 
that
 
can
 
power
 
advanced
 
features—from
 
investor-ready
 
presentations
 
to
 
deeply
 
integrated
 
search
 
and
 
retrieval
 
functionalities.
 
 
With
 
these
 
utilities
 
in
 
place,
 
users
 
can
 
rapidly
 
iterate
 
on
 
new
 
data
 
sources
 
and
 
tasks,
 
confident
 
in
 
a
 
pipeline
 
that
 
effectively
 
handles
 
a
 
wide
 
range
 
of
 
file
 
types
 
and
 
input
 
sizes.
 
This
 
synergy
 
between
 
extraction
 
and
 
summarization
 
is
 
what
 
makes
 
the
 
project
 
truly
 
versatile—enabling
 
it
 
to
 
serve
 
as
 
a
 
foundation
 
for
 
analytics,
 
AI-driven
 
content
 
creation,
 
or
 
interactive
 
knowledge
 
systems.
