The provided code outlines a framework for generating presentation slides using a language model (LLM). It involves several key components:

1. **Data Structures**: Defines classes for slides, presentation state, layout components, and styles using Python's `dataclass` and `pydantic` for validation.

2. **Presentation Planning**: The `PresentationPlanner` class utilizes the LLM to create a detailed layout plan for slides based on a given topic and context. It formats the output as JSON.

3. **Slide Generation**: The `SlideGenerator` class generates content for each slide using the LLM, returning only the HTML content without additional explanations.

4. **Combining Slides**: The `PresentationCombiner` class assembles the generated slides into a complete HTML presentation, integrating necessary JavaScript libraries for functionality.

5. **Workflow Management**: The `create_presentation_graph` function orchestrates the planning, generating, and combining of slides using a directed graph structure.

6. **Execution**: The `generate_presentation` function initializes the presentation state, determines the number of slides, and runs the workflow, ultimately saving the result as an HTML file.

The code is designed to be executed asynchronously, leveraging concurrent processing for slide generation. It also includes an example of usage, demonstrating how to generate a presentation based on a specific topic and context.
