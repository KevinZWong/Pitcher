=== example.py ===

The provided code creates a video from an image using the MoviePy library and dynamic movement effects. It sets parameters such as frame rate, duration, resolution, and image path. The image is resized to ensure it meets a minimum upscale requirement of 1.5 times the final video resolution. A temporary resized image is saved, and a dynamic position clip is generated using a movement model loaded from a JSON file. Finally, the composite video is saved to a specified output path, and the temporary image file is deleted.

The data consists of three sets of values: x_values, y_values, and z_values. The x_values are [4, 193, 280, 519, 855, 803, 463], corresponding to y_values [3, 287, 670, 955, 823, 513, 397]. The z_values range from 0.0 to 10.0, with specific increments indicating a potential relationship or trend among the x and y values.

=== PathCreator.py ===

The provided code is a Python script that utilizes the Tkinter library for a graphical user interface (GUI) to select points representing a path for an image. Users are prompted to select points, which are then processed to create a 3D spline model using the Spline3D class. After selecting the path points, users can adjust speed values through a slider interface. The script collects these inputs, constructs a 3D spline, visualizes it, and allows users to save the model with a specified name. Key libraries used include NumPy for numerical operations, SciPy for interpolation and optimization, and Matplotlib for plotting.


=== TimeAdjustment.py ===

The provided code defines a `SliderApp` class using Tkinter to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that features a slider for selecting time intervals between given points. The class initializes with specified length effects and a list of points, calculates intervals based on these inputs, and sets up the slider and a label for user instructions. A "Done" button allows users to finalize their selections, which triggers the application to close. The slider's values can be retrieved through the `get_slider_values` method. The application is launched in the main block, displaying the slider and allowing user interaction.


=== tkSliderWidget.py ===

The Mapling project utilizes a Tkinter widget created by Mengxun Li, which can be found on GitHub. The code defines a `Slider` class that inherits from `Frame`, allowing users to create a customizable slider interface. Key features include adjustable parameters for width, height, minimum and maximum values, step size, and the ability to show or hide values. The slider supports multiple bars, which can be moved within a defined range. The class includes methods for handling mouse events, updating bar positions, and calculating values based on user interactions. It also provides a callback mechanism for value changes. The slider's visual elements, such as lines and bars, are drawn on a canvas, ensuring a user-friendly experience.


=== DynamicEffects.py ===

The provided code defines a class `DynamicPositionClip` that creates a video where an image moves dynamically based on a specified movement model. The class initializes with parameters for frame rate, background width, and height. The `dynamicPosition` method calculates the image's position at a given time `t`, scaling the movement values to fit within the video frame while adjusting for the image's dimensions. The `generate_video` method creates a video clip by overlaying the image on a colored background, using the movement model to determine the image's position throughout the clip's duration. In the main block, the class is instantiated with specific parameters, a movement model is loaded from a JSON file, and the video is generated and saved to a specified output path.


=== README.md ===

Mapling is a video animation tool that transforms images into videos with customizable pan movements. It enlarges images to 150% of the video resolution and animates them at 60 frames per second using a customizable 3D spline graph for smooth movement paths. Users can create unique movement paths by running the PathCreator.py program, utilizing a GUI to select and adjust points for the desired motion. 

To install Mapling, users need Python 3.7+, pip, and a virtual environment. The installation involves cloning the repository and installing dependencies. After setting up, users can run examples to generate videos.

For custom movements, users create paths, adjust time intervals for speed, preview in 3D, and save their models. To use a custom model, users run Mapling.py, set video parameters via a GUI, select an image and model, and finalize the video for saving in the designated folder.


=== mapling_models/spline_data_loop.json ===

The provided data consists of three sets of values: x_values, y_values, and z_values. 

- **x_values**: [7, 317, 599, 678, 520, 325, 394, 648, 991]
- **y_values**: [-1, 113, 383, 715, 900, 800, 396, 212, 5]
- **z_values**: [0.0, 1.5, 3.66, 4.5, 4.89, 5.39, 6.29, 8.0, 10.0]

These values could represent a dataset for analysis, possibly indicating a relationship between the x and y values, with z values providing additional context or measurement.


=== PointSelection.py ===

The provided code defines a graphical user interface (GUI) application using Tkinter for selecting points on a canvas. The `PointSelectionApp` class initializes a canvas with labeled axes, where users can click to add points. It includes features such as:

- A canvas for drawing points and axis lines.
- Mouse event bindings to add points and update cursor lines.
- A listbox to display the coordinates of selected points.
- Buttons to clear points or finalize the selection.

Key functionalities include:
- `add_point`: Captures mouse clicks, scales coordinates, and displays them.
- `update_lines`: Updates cursor-following lines based on mouse movement.
- `clear_points`: Resets the canvas and clears the points list.
- `finalize_points`: Closes the app and can handle final actions on point selection.

The application allows users to interactively select points and view their coordinates in a structured format.


=== Spline3D.py ===

The provided code defines a `Spline3D` class that facilitates the creation and manipulation of 3D cubic splines using given x, y, and z points. Key functionalities include initializing spline data, plotting the 3D spline, finding x and y coordinates for a specified z value, and saving/loading spline data in JSON format.

### Key Features:
1. **Initialization**: Accepts x, y, and z points, creating cubic spline interpolations for each dimension.
2. **3D Plotting**: Uses Matplotlib to visualize the spline in a 3D space.
3. **Z-Value Queries**: Implements a method to find corresponding x and y values for a given z input using optimization.
4. **Data Management**: Provides methods to save the spline data to a JSON file and load it back, handling file creation and overwriting scenarios.
5. **Naming Convention**: Generates a unique model name based on the current timestamp.

### Example Usage:
The script initializes a `Spline3D` object with predefined path and speed points, plots the spline, and allows the user to save the data with a custom name. It also includes commented-out code for querying x and y values for a specific z input.


=== Mapling.py ===

The provided code is a Python script that utilizes the EasyGUI library for user input and the MoviePy library for video creation. It prompts users to enter video settings such as frame rate, clip duration, resolution, video name, and upscale factor. After validating the input, it allows users to select an image and a mapping model file, and choose a folder to save the output video. The script then resizes the selected image based on the specified upscale factor and resolution, generates a dynamic video using a movement model, and saves the final video as an MP4 file. Temporary files created during the process are deleted afterward.
