FUNCTION EXPLANATIONS

The function `addcss` is a custom Django template filter that is used to add CSS classes to form fields in a Django template. Here's a detailed explanation of its components:

1. **Decorator**: `@register.filter(name='addcss')`
   - This line uses the `register.filter` decorator to register the function as a template filter with the name 'addcss'. This means that the function can be used in Django templates to modify data.
   - `register` is an instance of `template.Library()`, which is used to register custom template tags and filters.

2. **Function Definition**: `def addcss(field, css):`
   - The function `addcss` takes two parameters: `field` and `css`.
   - `field`: This is expected to be a form field object, typically passed from a Django form.
   - `css`: This is a string representing the CSS class or classes to be added to the form field.

3. **Return Statement**: `return field.as_widget(attrs={"class":css})`
   - The function returns the form field rendered as a widget with additional HTML attributes.
   - `field.as_widget()`: This method is called on the form field object to render it as an HTML widget.
   - `attrs={"class":css}`: This dictionary specifies additional HTML attributes to be added to the widget. In this case, it adds a `class` attribute with the value of the `css` parameter, effectively adding the specified CSS classes to the form field.

Overall, this function is useful for dynamically adding CSS classes to form fields in Django templates, allowing for more flexible and customizable styling of forms.

The `main` function is designed to run administrative tasks for a Django project. Here's a detailed breakdown of its components:

1. **Docstring**: The function begins with a docstring that briefly describes its purpose: "Run administrative tasks."

2. **Environment Variable Setup**: The function sets a default value for the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable using `os.environ.setdefault`. This variable is crucial for Django as it specifies the settings module to be used. In this case, it is set to `'mysite.settings'`, which indicates that the settings for the Django project are located in the `mysite` package.

3. **Importing Django Management Command**: The function attempts to import `execute_from_command_line` from `django.core.management`. This function is used to execute command-line utilities for Django projects.

4. **Handling ImportError**: If the import fails, an `ImportError` is raised with a custom error message. This message suggests that Django might not be installed, or it might not be available on the `PYTHONPATH`. It also reminds the user to check if a virtual environment is activated, which is a common requirement for Django projects.

5. **Executing Command Line**: If the import is successful, the function calls `execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)`. This function takes the command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) and executes the appropriate Django management command. This allows the user to run various administrative tasks such as starting the server, applying migrations, or creating new apps within the Django project.

Overall, this function is a typical entry point for Django projects, enabling developers to manage their projects through command-line commands efficiently.

The `leaderboard` function is a Django view function that is responsible for rendering a leaderboard page. Here's a detailed explanation of its components:

1. **Function Definition**: The function is defined with the name `leaderboard` and takes a single parameter `request`, which is a standard parameter for Django view functions representing the HTTP request.

2. **Querying Users**:
   - `users_alltime`: This variable stores a queryset of `User` objects, ordered by the `-points_alltime` field in descending order. This means users with the highest all-time points will appear first.
   - `users_quarterly`: Similarly, this variable stores a queryset of `User` objects, ordered by the `-points_quarterly` field in descending order, meaning users with the highest quarterly points will appear first.

3. **Content Dictionary**: A dictionary named `content` is created to hold the context data that will be passed to the template. It contains two keys:
   - `'users_alltime'`: Associated with the `users_alltime` queryset.
   - `'users_quarterly'`: Associated with the `users_quarterly` queryset.

4. **Rendering the Template**: The function returns a call to the `render` function, which is used to generate an HTTP response with the given template and context data. It takes three arguments:
   - `request`: The HTTP request object.
   - `'leaderboard/leaderboard.html'`: The path to the template file that will be used to render the page.
   - `content`: The context dictionary containing the data to be displayed in the template.

Overall, this function is designed to display a leaderboard page that shows users ranked by their all-time and quarterly points, using data retrieved from the database and rendered through a specified HTML template.

The `badges` function is a Django view function that handles the display of badges for a user. Here's a detailed explanation of its components:

1. **Function Definition**: The function is defined with a single parameter `request`, which is an HttpRequest object representing the current request.

2. **User Authentication Check**: The function first checks if the user associated with the request is authenticated using `request.user.is_authenticated`. This is a boolean attribute that returns `True` if the user is logged in and `False` otherwise.

3. **Collected Badges**: If the user is authenticated, the function retrieves all badges that the user has earned by accessing `request.user.badges_earned.all()`. This assumes that there is a related name `badges_earned` set up in the user model that links to the badges the user has collected. If the user is not authenticated, an empty list is assigned to `collected`.

4. **All Badges Retrieval**: The function retrieves all badge objects from the database using `Badge.objects.all()`. This returns a QuerySet containing all instances of the `Badge` model.

5. **Rendering the Template**: The function returns a rendered HTML page using the `render` function. It passes the request, the template path `'badges/badges.html'`, and a context dictionary containing two keys: `'badges'` and `'collected'`. The `'badges'` key holds all badge objects, and the `'collected'` key holds the badges the user has earned (or an empty list if the user is not authenticated).

Overall, this function is responsible for preparing the data needed to display a list of all badges and highlighting those that the authenticated user has collected, then rendering this information in a specified HTML template.

The `prizes` function is a Django view function that handles the display of prizes on a webpage. Here's a detailed breakdown of its components:

1. **Function Definition**: The function is defined with a single parameter, `request`, which is an HttpRequest object representing the current request.

2. **User Authentication Check**: The function first checks if the user making the request is authenticated using `request.user.is_authenticated`. This is a boolean attribute that returns `True` if the user is logged in and `False` otherwise.

3. **Collected Prizes**: If the user is authenticated, the function retrieves all the prizes that the user has redeemed by accessing `request.user.prizes_redeemed.all()`. This assumes that there is a related model or field `prizes_redeemed` associated with the user model that keeps track of redeemed prizes. If the user is not authenticated, `collected` is set to an empty list.

4. **Retrieve All Prizes**: The function retrieves all prize objects from the database using `Prize.objects.all()`. This returns a QuerySet containing all instances of the `Prize` model.

5. **Render the Template**: The function uses the `render` shortcut to generate an HttpResponse. It renders the 'prizes/prizes.html' template, passing a context dictionary containing two keys: `'prizes'` and `'collected'`. The `'prizes'` key holds all the prize objects, and the `'collected'` key holds the prizes redeemed by the user (or an empty list if the user is not authenticated).

6. **Dependencies**: The function relies on Django's `render` function to render the template and the `Prize` model to query prize data from the database. The `Prize` model is defined with various fields such as `prize_name`, `coins_required`, `description`, etc., which are likely used in the template to display prize information.

Overall, this function is responsible for preparing the data needed to display a list of prizes and the prizes collected by the user, and then rendering this information in a web page using a specified template.

The `user` function is a Django view that handles the display of a user's profile page. Here's a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Parameters**:
   - `request`: The HTTP request object, which contains metadata about the request.
   - `username`: An optional parameter that specifies the username of the profile to be displayed.

2. **Redirect for Authenticated Users**:
   - If `username` is `None` and the user is authenticated (`request.user.is_authenticated`), the function redirects the user to their own profile page using `HttpResponseRedirect`.
   - If `username` is `None` and the user is not authenticated, an `Http404` exception is raised with the message "You are not logged in".

3. **User Retrieval**:
   - The function attempts to retrieve a `User` object from the database using the provided `username`.
   - If no user is found (`user` is `None`), an `Http404` exception is raised with the message "User does not exist".

4. **Rank Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the user's rank based on quarterly and all-time points.
   - `quarterly_overall`: The user's rank among all users based on quarterly points.
   - `quarterly_grade`: The user's rank among users of the same grade based on quarterly points.
   - `alltime_overall`: The user's rank among all users based on all-time points.
   - `alltime_grade`: The user's rank among users of the same grade based on all-time points.

5. **Delayed Notification**:
   - If the user has a `delayed_notification` message, it is displayed using Django's `messages` framework.
   - The `delayed_notification` field is then cleared and the user object is saved.

6. **Rendering the Template**:
   - The function prepares a context dictionary containing the current user, the profile being viewed, whether the profile belongs to the current user, and the calculated ranks.
   - It then renders the `user/user.html` template with this context using the `render` function.

The `events` function is a Django view function that retrieves and processes a list of events from the database, determines their status based on the current date and time, and renders them in an HTML template.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function is defined with a single parameter `request`, which is a standard parameter for Django view functions representing the HTTP request.

2. **Retrieving Events**:
   - `events_list = Event.objects.order_by('-start_date', '-start_time')`: This line queries the `Event` model to retrieve all event objects from the database, ordering them by `start_date` and `start_time` in descending order. This means the most recent events will appear first.

3. **Current Date and Time**:
   - `curr_date = today_date if today_date else date.today()`: This line sets `curr_date` to a predefined `today_date` if it exists; otherwise, it defaults to the current date using `date.today()`.
   - `curr_time = today_time if today_time else timezone.now().time()`: Similarly, this sets `curr_time` to a predefined `today_time` if it exists; otherwise, it defaults to the current time using `timezone.now().time()`.

4. **Processing Each Event**:
   - The function iterates over each event in `events_list` to determine its status:
     - **Upcoming**: Initially, each event is marked as 'upcoming' with a green color (`#bcf1b8`).
     - **Ongoing**: If the event's start date and time are before the current date and time, it is marked as 'ongoing' with a yellow color (`#ffeaca`).
     - **Ended**: If the event's end date and time are before the current date and time, it is marked as 'ended' with a red color (`#ffcaca`).
   - The status and color are then assigned to the event's `status` and `colour` attributes, respectively.

5. **Rendering the Template**:
   - `content = {'events_list': events_list}`: A context dictionary is created with the processed list of events.
   - `return render(request, 'events/events.html', content)`: The function uses Django's `render` shortcut to generate an HTTP response with the `events/events.html` template, passing the context dictionary to it.

Overall, this function is responsible for preparing a list of events with their respective statuses and rendering them in a web page for display to the user.

The `buy_prize` function is a Django view function that handles the process of a user attempting to purchase a prize using their coins. Here's a detailed explanation of its components:

1. **Function Signature**:
   - `def buy_prize(request, prize_id):`
   - The function takes two parameters: `request`, which is the HTTP request object, and `prize_id`, which is the unique identifier of the prize the user wants to buy.

2. **Prize Retrieval**:
   - `prize = Prize.objects.get(id=prize_id)`
   - This line retrieves the `Prize` object from the database using the provided `prize_id`. It assumes that the `Prize` model has been imported and is available in the context.

3. **User Authentication Check**:
   - `if request.user.is_authenticated:`
   - The function checks if the user making the request is authenticated. If not, it returns a 404 error.

4. **Coin Balance Check**:
   - `if request.user.coins >= prize.coins_required:`
   - If the user is authenticated, the function checks if the user has enough coins to purchase the prize. The `coins_required` attribute of the `Prize` object indicates how many coins are needed.

5. **Prize Redemption**:
   - If the user has enough coins, the function deducts the required coins from the user's balance and adds the prize to the user's redeemed prizes.
   - `request.user.coins -= prize.coins_required`
   - `request.user.prizes_redeemed.add(prize)`
   - `request.user.save()`
   - The user's updated coin balance and redeemed prizes are saved to the database.

6. **Success Message and Redirect**:
   - `messages.success(request, 'You have successfully redeemed the prize!')`
   - `return HttpResponseRedirect('../', 'GET')`
   - A success message is displayed to the user, and they are redirected to the previous page.

7. **Insufficient Coins Handling**:
   - If the user does not have enough coins, an error message is displayed, and the user is redirected to the previous page.
   - `messages.error(request, 'You do not have enough coins to redeem this prize!')`
   - `return HttpResponseRedirect('../', 'GET')`

8. **Unauthenticated User Handling**:
   - If the user is not authenticated, a 404 error is raised with a message indicating that the user is not logged in.
   - `return Http404('You are not logged in!')`

Overall, this function ensures that only authenticated users with sufficient coins can redeem prizes, and it provides appropriate feedback and redirection based on the outcome of the transaction.

The `index` function is a Django view function responsible for rendering the home page of a web application. Here's a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Upcoming Events:**
   - The function retrieves a list of events ordered by their publication date in descending order using `Event.objects.order_by('-pub_date')`.
   - It initializes two empty lists: `upcoming_events` and `upcoming_interested`.
   - It determines the current date and time using `today_date` and `today_time` from the configuration, defaulting to the current date and time if not provided.
   - It iterates over the list of events and checks if the event's start date and time are in the future compared to the current date and time.
   - If the user is authenticated and interested in the event, the event is added to the `upcoming_interested` list.
   - All upcoming events are added to the `upcoming_events` list, which is then truncated to the first three events.

2. **User Authentication Check:**
   - The function checks if the user is logged in using `request.user.is_authenticated` and stores the result in `is_logged_in`.

3. **Quarterly Leaderboard:**
   - The function retrieves a list of users ordered by their quarterly points in descending order using `User.objects.order_by('-points_quarterly')`.
   - If the user is not logged in or their position in the leaderboard is within the top 5, the leaderboard is truncated to the top 5 users.
   - If the user is logged in and not in the top 5, the leaderboard includes the top 2 users and the user's position along with one user above and below them.

4. **All-Time Leaderboard:**
   - Similar to the quarterly leaderboard, the function retrieves users ordered by their all-time points and applies the same logic for truncating the leaderboard.

5. **Past Winners:**
   - The function retrieves a list of users who are past winners, ordered by their username.

6. **Rendering the Template:**
   - Finally, the function renders the `home/index.html` template, passing the lists of upcoming events, interested events, quarterly leaderboard, all-time leaderboard, and past winners as context variables.

This function is a typical example of a Django view that prepares data for display on a web page by querying the database, processing the data, and rendering a template with the processed data.

The `full_event` function is a Django view that handles the display and interaction with a specific event based on its `event_id`. Here's a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Event Retrieval**: The function attempts to retrieve an `Event` object from the database using the provided `event_id`. If the event does not exist, it raises an `Http404` exception, indicating that the event could not be found.

2. **POST Request Handling**: If the request method is POST, the function checks if the current user is already marked as interested in the event:
   - If the user is interested, they are removed from the event's interested list, and a message is displayed indicating they are no longer interested.
   - If the user is not interested, they are added to the event's interested list, and a success message is displayed.
   - After updating the interested status, the function redirects the user back to the same page using `HttpResponseRedirect`.

3. **Manager and Organizer Flags**: The function determines if the current user is a manager or organizer of the event:
   - A user is considered a manager if they are the event organizer, a staff member, or a superuser.
   - A user is considered an organizer if they are the event's organizer.

4. **Current Date and Time**: The function retrieves the current date and time, using `today_date` and `today_time` if they are set, otherwise defaulting to the current date and time.

5. **Event Status**: The function checks if the event has started or ended:
   - An event is considered started if its start date and time are before the current date and time.
   - An event is considered ended if its end date and time are before the current date and time.

6. **Rendering the Template**: Finally, the function renders the `full_event.html` template, passing the event details, manager and organizer flags, and event status (started or ended) as context variables to the template.

The `register` function is a Django view function responsible for handling user registration. Here's a detailed explanation of its components:

1. **Function Definition**: The function is defined with a single parameter, `request`, which is an HttpRequest object representing the current request.

2. **Form Initialization**: The function begins by creating an instance of `CreateUserForm`, which is presumably a form class designed to handle user registration data. This instance is stored in the variable `userForm`.

3. **Request Method Check**: The function checks if the request method is 'POST'. This is a common practice in web development to determine if the form has been submitted. If the method is 'POST', it indicates that the user has submitted the registration form.

4. **Form Binding and Validation**: If the request method is 'POST', the function creates a new instance of `CreateUserForm`, this time binding it to the data submitted in the request (`request.POST`). The `is_valid()` method is then called on this form instance to check if the submitted data meets all the validation criteria defined in the form.

5. **Form Submission Handling**: If the form is valid, the `save()` method is called on the form instance. This method typically saves the form data to the database, creating a new user account.

6. **Redirection**: After successfully saving the form data, the function redirects the user to the homepage ('/'). This is done using Django's `redirect` function, which sends an HTTP redirect response to the client.

7. **Rendering the Template**: If the request method is not 'POST' or if the form is not valid, the function renders the 'home/register.html' template. It passes the `userForm` instance to the template context, allowing the template to display the form to the user. This is done using Django's `render` function, which combines a template with a context dictionary and returns an HttpResponse object.

Overall, this function handles both the display of the registration form and the processing of form submissions, including validation and user creation.

The `update` function is a Django view function responsible for handling the update of a user's profile. Here's a detailed explanation of its components:

1. **Authentication Check**: The function first checks if the user is authenticated using `request.user.is_authenticated`. If the user is not logged in, it raises an `Http404` exception with the message "You are not logged in". This prevents unauthenticated users from accessing the profile update functionality.

2. **Form Initialization**: An instance of `EditProfileForm` is created with the current user's data (`instance=request.user`). This form is used to display the user's existing profile information, allowing them to make changes.

3. **User Retrieval**: The current user is retrieved from the request object and stored in the `user` variable. This is used later to pass the user information to the template.

4. **POST Request Handling**: The function checks if the request method is 'POST', indicating that the form has been submitted. If so, it creates a new instance of `EditProfileForm` with the submitted data (`request.POST`) and the current user's instance.

5. **Form Validation and Saving**: The form is validated using `editForm.is_valid()`. If the form data is valid, the changes are saved to the user's profile using `editForm.save()`.

6. **Redirection**: After successfully saving the form, the user is redirected to the '/user/' URL using `HttpResponseRedirect`. This typically takes the user back to their profile page or a confirmation page.

7. **Rendering the Template**: If the request method is not 'POST', or if the form is invalid, the function renders the 'home/update.html' template. It passes the current user and the form (either pre-filled with existing data or with errors) to the template context, allowing the user to view and edit their profile information.

Overall, this function provides a secure and user-friendly way for authenticated users to update their profile information in a Django application.

The `admit` function is a Django view that handles the admission of users to an event. Here's a detailed explanation of its components:

1. **Function Signature**:

   - It takes two parameters: `request`, which is the HTTP request object, and `event_id`, which is the ID of the event to which users are being admitted.

2. **Event Retrieval**:
   - The function attempts to retrieve the event object from the database using the provided `event_id`.
   - If the event does not exist, it raises an `Http404` exception with the message "Event does not exist".

3. **Authorization Check**:
   - The function checks if the requesting user is authorized to admit users to the event.
   - The user must be the event organizer, a staff member, or a superuser.
   - If the user is not authorized, an `Http404` exception is raised with the message "You are not the organizer of this event".

4. **User List Preparation**:
   - It retrieves all users interested in the event, ordering them by their last name in descending order.

5. **Handling POST Requests**:
   - If the request method is POST, it processes the form submission.
   - It retrieves a list of usernames from the POST data that are marked for admission.
   - It iterates over the list of interested users:
     - If a user's username is in the list of checked users and they are not already a participant, they are added to the event's participants.
     - If a user's username is not in the list of checked users and they are currently a participant, they are removed from the event's participants.
   - After updating the participants, it adds a success message to the request and redirects the user back to the same page.

6. **Rendering the Template**:
   - If the request method is not POST, it renders the 'events/admit.html' template, passing the event and the list of users as context.

The `end_quarter` function is designed to handle the end-of-quarter process for a system that tracks user points and distributes prizes. Here's a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Authentication and Authorization Check:**
   - The function first checks if the request's user is authenticated. If not, it raises an `Http404` error with the message "You are not logged in."
   - It then checks if the user is a superuser (admin). If not, it raises an `Http404` error with the message "You are not an admin!"

2. **User Retrieval and Sorting:**
   - It retrieves all users from the database using `User.objects.all()` and sorts them in descending order based on their `points_quarterly` attribute.
   - The top user (with the highest quarterly points) is automatically added to the `winners` list.

3. **Grade-Based Winner Selection:**
   - The function iterates over grades 9 to 12.
   - For each grade, it filters users belonging to that grade and randomly selects one user to be added to the `winners` list, provided there are users in that grade.

4. **Prize Distribution and Notification:**
   - The function iterates over all users to reset their `past_winner` status and `past_prize`.
   - If a user is in the `winners` list:
     - It sets `past_winner` to `True`.
     - If the user has redeemed all available prizes, they receive a $10 gift card, and a notification is set.
     - Otherwise, a random prize is selected from the available prizes that the user hasn't redeemed yet, and a notification is set.
   - If a user is not a winner, they receive a notification that the quarter has ended.

5. **Points Reset and User Save:**
   - The function resets the `points_quarterly` attribute of each user to 0.
   - It saves the updated user information to the database.

6. **Success Message and Redirection:**
   - A success message is added to the request, indicating that quarterly points have been reset and prizes distributed.
   - The function returns an `HttpResponseRedirect` to redirect the user to the previous page ("../").

Overall, this function manages the end-of-quarter process by selecting winners, distributing prizes, resetting points, and notifying users accordingly.

The `admit_user` function is designed to admit a user to an event in a Django web application. Here's a detailed explanation of its functionality:

   - If the event does not exist, it raises an `Http404` exception with the message "Event does not exist".

3. **Authorization Check**:
   - The function checks if the requesting user is authorized to admit users to the event. This is done by verifying if the user is the event organizer, a staff member, or a superuser.
   - If the user is not authorized, an `Http404` exception is raised with the message "You are not the organizer of this event".

4. **User Retrieval**:
   - The function attempts to retrieve the user object from the database using the provided `username`.
   - If the user does not exist, it raises an `Http404` exception with a message indicating that the user does not exist.

5. **Admitting the User**:
   - The function checks if the user is interested in the event and not already a participant.
   - If both conditions are met, the user is added to the event's participants, and the event is added to the user's list of participated events.
   - A success message is displayed indicating that the user has been admitted.

6. **Handling Other Cases**:
   - If the user is not interested in the event, an informational message is displayed stating that the user is not interested.
   - If the user is already a participant, an informational message is displayed stating that the user is already admitted.

7. **Saving Changes**:
   - The function saves the changes to both the event and the user objects.

8. **Redirect**:
   - Finally, the function redirects the user to the previous page using `HttpResponseRedirect('../')`.

This function is a typical example of handling user admission to an event in a web application, ensuring proper authorization and providing feedback to the user through messages.

The `propagate` function is designed to propagate points to participants of a specific event. Here's a detailed explanation of its functionality:

1. **Function Signature**: 
   - `def propagate(request, event_id):`
   - It takes two parameters: `request`, which is likely an HTTP request object, and `event_id`, which is the primary key of the event.

### Imports:

- The code imports necessary modules and classes from Django and Python's standard library:
  - `datetime` from Python's standard library for handling date and time.
  - `migrations` and `models` from `django.db` for defining the migration and model.
  - `utc` from `django.utils.timezone` to specify the timezone for the `date_received` field.

The `Tag` class is a Django model that represents a tag entity in a database. It is a subclass of `models.Model`, which is a base class provided by Django for defining models. Here's a breakdown of the components of this class:

1. **Attributes:**
   - `tag`: This is a `CharField` with a maximum length of 100 characters. It is used to store the name or label of the tag.
   - `colour`: This is another `CharField` with a maximum length of 100 characters. It is used to store the color associated with the tag, which could be a color name or a hexadecimal color code.

2. **Methods:**
   - `__str__`: This is a special method in Python that returns a string representation of the object. In this class, it returns the value of the `tag` attribute, which means when an instance of `Tag` is printed or converted to a string, it will display the tag's name.

3. **Usage:**
   - This class can be used to create, retrieve, update, and delete tag records in the database. Each instance of the `Tag` class corresponds to a row in the database table that Django creates for this model.
   - The `tag` and `colour` fields can be used to filter and query the database for specific tags based on their name or color.

Overall, the `Tag` class is a simple representation of a tag with a name and color, and it leverages Django's ORM capabilities to interact with the database.

The `CreateUserForm` class is a custom form for creating a new user in a Django application. It extends the `UserCreationForm` provided by Django, which is a form that handles user creation with fields for username, password, and password confirmation.

### Components of the `CreateUserForm` class:

1. **Inheritance**:
   - The class inherits from `UserCreationForm`, which is part of Django's authentication system. This base form provides fields and validation for creating a new user, including password validation.

2. **Custom Field**:
   - `grade = forms.CharField()`: This line adds a custom field named `grade` to the form. `forms.CharField()` is a Django form field that represents a text input. This field is not part of the default `UserCreationForm` and is added to collect additional information about the user, specifically their grade.

3. **Meta Class**:
   - The `Meta` class is used to specify metadata for the form. It includes:
     - `model = User`: This specifies that the form is associated with the `User` model. The `User` model is typically the default user model provided by Django, but it can be customized using `get_user_model()`.
     - `fields = ['username', 'email', 'password1', 'password2', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'grade']`: This list defines the fields that will be included in the form. It includes the default fields from `UserCreationForm` (username, password1, password2) and additional fields such as email, first_name, last_name, and the custom `grade` field.

### Purpose:
The purpose of the `CreateUserForm` class is to extend the default user creation form to include additional fields that are specific to the application's requirements. By adding fields like `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `grade`, the form can collect more comprehensive user information during the registration process.

The `Event` class is a Django model that represents an event in a database. It is a subclass of `models.Model`, which means it is a Django model and will be translated into a database table. Here's a detailed breakdown of its components:

1. **Fields:**
   - `event_title`: A `CharField` with a maximum length of 200 characters, representing the title of the event.
   - `organizer`: A `ForeignKey` to the `User` model, with a constraint that limits choices to users who are staff (`is_staff: True`). It has a `related_name` of 'organizer', allowing reverse access from the `User` model.
   - `pub_date`: A `DateTimeField` that records when the event was added, with a default value of the current time (`timezone.now()`).
   - `start_date` and `end_date`: `DateField` fields representing the start and end dates of the event.
   - `start_time` and `end_time`: `TimeField` fields representing the start and end times of the event.
   - `points`: An `IntegerField` with a default value of 0, possibly representing some scoring or reward system related to the event.
   - `description`: A `TextField` for a detailed description of the event, which can be left blank.
   - `location`: A `CharField` with a maximum length of 200 characters, defaulting to "School".
   - `image`: An `ImageField` for uploading an image related to the event, stored in 'static/img/event_images/'. It can be null or blank.
   - `interested` and `participants`: `ManyToManyField` fields linking to the `User` model, representing users interested in or participating in the event, respectively. Both fields are optional (blank=True) and have distinct `related_name` values for reverse access.
   - `id`: A `UUIDField` that serves as the primary key, with a default value generated by `uuid.uuid4`.
   - `tags`: A `ManyToManyField` linking to the `Tag` model, allowing events to be tagged with multiple tags.
   - `visibility`: A `BooleanField` indicating whether the event is visible, defaulting to `False`.
   - `points_propagated`: A `BooleanField` indicating whether points have been propagated, defaulting to `False`.

2. **Methods:**
   - `__str__`: Returns the `event_title` as the string representation of the event.
   - `was_published_recently`: Returns `True` if the event was published within the last day, using the `pub_date` field.
   - `clean`: This method is commented out, but it is intended to perform validation on the event's start and end dates and times. It raises a `ValidationError` if the end date is before the start date, or if the end time is before the start time on the same day. It returns a dictionary of the cleaned data.

Overall, this class is designed to manage event data, including details about the event's timing, location, participants, and organizational metadata. It also includes validation logic to ensure the integrity of the event's schedule.

The `EditProfileForm` class is a Django form that is used to update user profiles. It is a subclass of `ModelForm`, which is a Django form class that automatically generates form fields based on the fields of a specified model. In this case, the model specified is `User`, which is likely a custom user model obtained using `get_user_model()`.

### Key Components:

- **ModelForm**: This is a Django form class that allows you to create forms based on Django models. It automatically generates form fields for the model fields specified in the `fields` attribute.

- **Meta Class**: This is an inner class used to specify metadata options for the `ModelForm`. In this case, it specifies the model to use (`User`) and the fields to include in the form.

- **Fields**: The `fields` attribute in the `Meta` class is a list of field names that should be included in the form. These fields are `username`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `bio`, `email`, `grade`, and `tags_interested`. These fields correspond to the attributes of the `User` model that the form will allow users to update.

### Usage:

This form can be used in a Django view to render a form for editing user profiles. When the form is submitted, it can be validated and saved to update the user's profile information in the database. This is particularly useful in web applications where users need to update their personal information.

   - **Modularity**: The use of `include()` allows for modular URL configurations, making it easier to manage and organize URLs across different apps within the project.
   - **Namespace Support**: The use of namespaces (e.g., `namespace='qr_code'`) helps in avoiding URL name conflicts across different apps.
   - **Admin Interface**: Integration with Django's admin interface provides a powerful tool for managing the application's data and users.
   - **Authentication**: Inclusion of Django's built-in authentication URLs facilitates user authentication and management.

Overall, this file serves as a central routing mechanism for directing HTTP requests to the appropriate views based on the URL patterns defined, enabling the Django application to respond to user requests effectively.

This file is a Django URL configuration file, which is used to define URL patterns for a Django application. Here's a detailed explanation of its features:

1. **Imports**:
   - `from django.urls import path`: This imports the `path` function from Django's `urls` module, which is used to define URL patterns.
   - `from . import views`: This imports the `views` module from the current package, allowing the URL patterns to reference view functions defined in that module.

2. **App Name**:
   - `app_name = 'prizes'`: This sets the application namespace to 'prizes'. This is useful for namespacing URLs in Django, especially when using the `include()` function to include URL configurations from other apps. It helps in avoiding URL name clashes across different apps.

3. **URL Patterns**:
   - `urlpatterns = [...]`: This is a list that contains URL pattern definitions. Each pattern is defined using the `path()` function, which maps a URL pattern to a view function.

   - `path('', views.prizes, name='prizes')`: This pattern maps the root URL of the app (i.e., '/') to the `prizes` view function in the `views` module. The `name='prizes'` argument assigns a name to this URL pattern, which can be used for reverse URL matching.

   - `path('<str:prize_id>/', views.buy_prize, name='buy_prize')`: This pattern maps URLs that include a string parameter (e.g., '/some-prize-id/') to the `buy_prize` view function. The `<str:prize_id>` part captures a string from the URL and passes it as an argument to the `buy_prize` view. The `name='buy_prize'` argument assigns a name to this URL pattern for reverse URL matching.

Overall, this file defines two URL patterns for a Django app named 'prizes'. The first pattern is for displaying a list of prizes, and the second pattern is for buying a specific prize identified by a `prize_id`. The use of named URL patterns allows for easy reference and reverse URL resolution in templates and views.

This file is a Django URL configuration file, which is used to define URL patterns for a Django application. Here's a detailed explanation of its components and features:

1. **Imports**:
   - `from django.urls import path`: This import statement brings in the `path` function from Django's `urls` module, which is used to define URL patterns.
   - `from . import views`: This imports the `views` module from the current package. The `views` module typically contains view functions that handle requests and return responses.

2. **Namespace**:
   - `app_name = 'user'`: This line sets the application namespace to 'user'. Namespaces are used in Django to differentiate URL names between different applications, which is particularly useful when using the `include()` function to include other URL configurations.

3. **URL Patterns**:
   - `urlpatterns = [...]`: This is a list of URL patterns that map URLs to view functions. Each pattern is defined using the `path()` function.
     - `path('', views.user, name='user')`: This pattern matches the root URL of the application (i.e., the empty string `''`). It maps this URL to the `user` view function in the `views` module and names this URL pattern 'user'.
     - `path('<str:username>/', views.user, name='user')`: This pattern matches URLs that include a string parameter `username`. It also maps these URLs to the `user` view function and names the pattern 'user'. The angle brackets `<str:username>` indicate that this part of the URL is a variable that will be passed to the view function as a keyword argument.

**Features**:
- **Routing**: The file defines how different URLs should be handled by the application. It routes requests to the appropriate view functions based on the URL pattern.
- **Dynamic URL Handling**: The use of `<str:username>/` allows the application to handle dynamic URLs where `username` can be any string. This is useful for user-specific pages.
- **Namespacing**: By setting an `app_name`, the file helps in organizing URL names, which is beneficial when the project grows and includes multiple applications.

Overall, this file is crucial for directing incoming web requests to the correct view functions, enabling the application to respond appropriately to different URLs.

The provided code snippet is a basic structure of a Django views file. Here's a detailed explanation of its components and purpose:

1. **Import Statement**:
   - `from django.shortcuts import render`: This line imports the `render` function from Django's `shortcuts` module. The `render` function is commonly used in Django views to render HTML templates and return an HTTP response. It simplifies the process of combining a template with a context dictionary and returning an `HttpResponse` object.

2. **Comment**:
   - `# Create your views here.`: This is a placeholder comment indicating where the developer should define their view functions or classes. In Django, views are responsible for handling HTTP requests, processing data, and returning HTTP responses. They act as the intermediary between the models (data) and templates (presentation).

3. **Purpose of the File**:
   - This file is typically named `views.py` and is part of a Django application. It is where developers define the logic for handling different web requests. Each view function or class corresponds to a specific URL pattern and is responsible for returning the appropriate response.
   - The file is currently empty, aside from the import and comment, indicating that no views have been defined yet. Developers will add view functions or class-based views to handle various actions, such as displaying a webpage, processing form data, or interacting with the database.

4. **Features**:
   - The primary feature of this file is to serve as a container for view logic in a Django application. It allows developers to define how different URLs should be processed and what responses should be returned.
   - By using the `render` function, developers can easily integrate templates with context data, making it straightforward to generate dynamic web pages.

In summary, this file is a starting point for defining the view logic in a Django application. It provides the necessary import for rendering templates and a placeholder for developers to add their view functions or classes.
