## Customer Satisfaction Metrics and Measurement Methods for JournalAI

### Executive Summary
This document provides a comprehensive overview of customer satisfaction metrics and measurement methods tailored for JournalAI, a startup that leverages AI to analyze journal entries, perform sentiment analysis, track moods, and recommend songs. Customer satisfaction is paramount for the success of JournalAI as the startup aims to foster user engagement and retention in a competitive mental health and wellness market. 

### Customer Satisfaction Metrics

1. **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**
   - **Definition**: NPS is a widely used metric to gauge customer loyalty and satisfaction based on the likelihood of users recommending a service to others.
   - **Target NPS**: Aim for an NPS of +50, which is considered excellent in the technology sector. As a benchmark, leading mental wellness apps like Headspace report NPS scores of +60.
   - **Methodology**: Users will be surveyed post-interaction with the platform using the question: “On a scale from 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend JournalAI to a friend?” Responses will categorize users into Promoters (9-10), Passives (7-8), and Detractors (0-6).
   - **Example**: If 200 surveyed users provide the following scores:
     - 120 Promoters
     - 50 Passives
     - 30 Detractors
     - **NPS Calculation**: NPS = %Promoters - %Detractors = (120/200 * 100) - (30/200 * 100) = 60% - 15% = **+45**.
   - **Frequency**: Conduct NPS surveys quarterly to track changes.

2. **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)**
   - **Definition**: CSAT measures customer satisfaction with a specific interaction or the overall experience.
   - **Target CSAT**: Set a target score of 85% or higher, which reflects a high level of satisfaction.
   - **Methodology**: After using features like mood tracking or song recommendations, users would be prompted with the question, "How satisfied were you with your experience?" rated on a 1-5 scale.
   - **Example**: If 250 users rate their experience, the result can be:
     - 125 (5 stars) 
     - 75 (4 stars)
     - 30 (3 stars)
     - 20 (2 stars)
     - 10 (1 star)
     - **CSAT Calculation**: CSAT = (125 + 75 + 30)/(250) * 100 = 80% satisfaction.
   - **Frequency**: Monthly feedback assessments to adjust features accordingly.

3. **Customer Effort Score (CES)**
   - **Definition**: CES measures how easy it is for users to interact with the platform.
   - **Target CES**: Aim for a CES of 4.5 or higher on a 5-point scale.
   - **Methodology**: After a user logs a journal entry or accesses a summary, a prompt asks, "How easy was it to complete this task?".
   - **Example**: If 300 users respond, the outcome is:
     - 150 (5)
     - 100 (4)
     - 30 (3)
     - 15 (2)
     - 5 (1)
     - **CES Calculation**: CES = (150 + 100 + 30)/(300) = 83.3% find it easy or very easy.
   - **Frequency**: Implemented after each major feature interaction.

### Feedback Systems

1. **In-App Feedback Mechanism**
   - **Implementation**: Users can submit feedback directly through the app, allowing for real-time suggestions and issues reporting.
   - **Features**:
     - An "Feedback" button on the main dashboard.
     - Option for users to categorize feedback (e.g., bugs, suggestions, compliments).
   - **Metrics**: Track the number of feedback submissions and categorize feedback for further analysis.

2. **User Interviews and Focus Groups**
   - **Implementation**: Schedule sessions with a demographic representative of the user base to gain deeper insights into user experiences and expectations.
   - **Structure**: Conduct bi-annual focus groups with 10-15 users to explore pain points and desired enhancements.
   - **Metrics**: Qualitative data collection and thematic analysis of user feedback for actionable insights.

3. **Email Surveys Post-Usage**
   - **Implementation**: Send out brief surveys after significant milestones (e.g., 10 journal entries logged) to assess user satisfaction and gather qualitative data.
   - **Metrics**: Analyze open and response rates to determine engagement levels with survey requests.

### Industry-Specific Insights
The mental health and wellness app market experienced a surge, with a projected CAGR of 23.5% from 2021 to 2028.
